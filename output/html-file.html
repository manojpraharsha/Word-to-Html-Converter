<h1>Shoulder Anatomy</h1>
<p> The shoulder is the most flexible joint in the body enabling a wide range of movements including, forward flexion, abduction, adduction, external rotation, internal rotation, and 360-degree circumduction. </p>
<p> Thus, the shoulder joint is considered the most insecure joint of the body but the support of ligaments, muscles and tendons function to provide the required stability. </p>
<h2> Bones of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> The shoulder is a ball and socket joint made up of three bones, namely the humerus, scapula and clavicle. </p>
<p> The end of the humerus or upper arm bone forms the ball of the shoulder joint. An irregular shallow cavity in the scapula called the glenoid cavity forms the socket for the head of the humerus to fit in. The two bones together form the glenohumeral joint, which is the main joint of the shoulder. </p>
<p> The scapula is a flat triangular-shaped bone that forms the shoulder blade. It serves as the site of attachment for most of the muscles that provide movement and stability to the joint. The scapula has four bony processes - acromion, spine, coracoid and glenoid cavity. The acromion and coracoid process serve as places for attachment of the ligaments and tendons. </p>
<p> The clavicle bone or collarbone is an S-shaped bone that connects the scapula to the sternum or breastbone. It forms two joints: the acromioclavicular joint, where it articulates with the acromion process of the scapula, and the sternoclavicular joint where it articulates with the sternum or breast bone. The clavicle also forms a protective covering for important nerves and blood vessels that pass under it from the spine to the arms. </p>
<h2> Soft Tissues of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> The ends of all articulating bones are covered by smooth tissue called articular cartilage which allows the bones to slide over each other without friction enabling smooth movement. Articular cartilage reduces pressure and acts as a shock absorber during movement of the shoulder bones. </p>
<p> Extra stability to the glenohumeral joint is provided by the glenoid labrum, a ring of fibrous cartilage that surrounds the glenoid cavity. The glenoid labrum increases the depth and surface area of the glenoid cavity to provide a more secure fit for the half-spherical head of the humerus. </p>
<h2> Ligaments of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> Ligaments are the thick strands of fibers that connect one bone to another. The ligaments of the shoulder joint include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Coraco-clavicular ligaments: These ligaments connect the collarbone to the shoulder blade at the coracoid process. </li>
    <li> Acromio-clavicular ligament: This connects the collarbone to the shoulder blade at the acromion process. </li>
    <li> Coraco-acromial ligament: It connects the acromion process to the coracoid process. </li>
    <li> Glenohumeral ligaments: A group of 3 ligaments that form a capsule around the shoulder joint, and connect the head of the arm bone to the glenoid cavity of the shoulder blade. The capsule forms a water-tight sac around the joint. Glenohumeral ligaments play a very important role in providing stability to the otherwise unstable shoulder joint by preventing dislocation. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Muscles of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> The rotator cuff is the main group of muscles in the shoulder joint and is comprised of 4 muscles. The rotator cuff forms a sleeve around the humeral head and glenoid cavity, providing additional stability to the shoulder joint while enabling a wide range of mobility. </p>
<p> The deltoid muscle forms the outer layer of the rotator cuff and is the largest and strongest muscle of the shoulder joint. </p>
<h2> Tendons of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> Tendons are strong tissues that join muscle to bone allowing the muscle to control the movement of the bone or joint. Two important groups of tendons in the shoulder joint are the biceps tendons and rotator cuff tendons. </p>
<p> Bicep tendons are the two tendons that join the bicep muscle of the upper arm to the shoulder. They are referred to as the long head and short head of the bicep. </p>
<p> Rotator cuff tendons are a group of four tendons that join the head of the humerus to the deeper muscles of the rotator cuff. These tendons provide more stability and mobility to the shoulder joint. </p>
<h2> Nerves of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> Nerves carry messages from the brain to muscles to direct movement (motor nerves) and send information about different sensations such as touch, temperature and pain from the muscles back to the brain (sensory nerves). The nerves of the arm pass through the shoulder joint from the neck. </p>
<p> These nerves form a bundle at the region of the shoulder called the brachial plexus. The main nerves of the brachial plexus are the musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, ulnar and median nerves. </p>
<h2> Blood vessels of the Shoulder </h2>
<p> Blood vessels travel along with the nerves to supply blood to the arms. Oxygenated blood is supplied to the shoulder region by the subclavian artery that runs below the collarbone. As it enters the region of the armpit, it is called the axillary artery and further down the arm, it is called the brachial artery. The main veins carrying de-oxygenated blood back to the heart for purification include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Axillary vein: this vein drains into the subclavian vein </li>
    <li> Cephalic vein: this vein is found in the upper arm and branches at the elbow into the forearm region. It drains into the axillary vein. </li>
    <li> Basilic vein: this vein runs opposite the cephalic vein, near the triceps muscle. It drains into the axillary vein. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Shoulder Pain</h1>
<h2> What is Shoulder Pain? </h2>
<p> Pain in the shoulder suggests a shoulder injury which is more common in athletes participating in sports such as swimming, tennis, pitching and weightlifting. The injuries are caused due to the over usage or repetitive motion of the arms. </p>
<p> In addition to pain, shoulder injuries also cause stiffness, restricted movements, difficulty in performing routine activities and popping sensation. </p>
<h2> What are the Most Common Causes of Shoulder Pain? </h2>
<p> Some of the common shoulder injuries that cause pain and restrict the movement of shoulders, include sprains and strains, dislocations, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injury, fractures and arthritis. </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Sprains and strains</strong> : A sprain is stretching or tearing of ligaments (tissues that connect adjacent bones in a joint). It is a common injury and usually occurs when you fall or suddenly twist. A strain is stretching or tearing of muscle or tendon (tissues that connect muscle to bone). It is common in people participating in sports. Strains are usually caused by twisting or pulling of the tendons. </li>
    <li> <strong>Dislocations</strong> : A shoulder dislocation is an injury that occurs when the end of the bone is forced out of its position. It is often caused by a fall or direct blow to the joint while playing contact sport. </li>
    <li> <strong>Tendinitis</strong> : It is an inflammation of a tendon, a tissue that connects muscles to bone. It occurs because of injury or overuse. </li>
    <li> <strong>Bursitis:</strong> It is an inflammation of a fluid-filled sac called bursa that protects and cushions your joints. Bursitis can be caused by chronic overuse, injury, arthritis, gout or infection. </li>
    <li> <strong>Rotator cuff injury</strong> : The rotator cuff consists of tendons and muscles that hold the bones of the shoulder joint together. Rotator cuff muscles allow you to move your arm up and down. Rotator cuff injuries often cause a decreased range of motion. </li>
    <li> <strong>Fractures</strong> : A fracture is a break in the bone that commonly occurs because of injury, such as a fall or a direct blow to the shoulder. </li>
    <li> <strong>Arthritis</strong> : Osteoarthritis is the most common type of shoulder arthritis, characterized by progressive wearing away of the cartilage of the joint. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Treatment for Shoulder Pain </h2>
<p> Early treatment is necessary to prevent serious shoulder injuries. The immediate mode of treatment recommended for shoulder injuries is rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE). Your doctor may also prescribe anti-inflammatory medications to help reduce the swelling and pain. </p>
<p> Your doctor may recommend certain exercises to prevent stiffness and improve range of motion and strength. Passive manipulation and massage therapy to improve blood circulation and healing are also administered. Other techniques such as acupuncture, TENS, and ultrasound therapy may additionally be recommended. </p>
<h1>Rotator Cuff Tear</h1>
<h2> What is a Rotator Cuff Tear? </h2>
<p> The rotator cuff is a group of tendons in the shoulder joint providing support and enabling a wide range of motion. Major injury to these tendons may result in tear of these tendons, a condition called rotator cuff tear. It is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain in middle aged adults and older individuals. </p>
<h2> What are the Causes of Rotator Cuff Tears? </h2>
<p> Rotator cuff tear results from pressure on the rotator cuff from part of the shoulder blade (scapula) as the arm is lifted. It may occur with repeated use of arm for overhead activities, while playing sports or during motor accidents. </p>
<h2> What are the Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Tears? </h2>
<p> Rotator cuff tear causes severe pain, weakness of the arm, and crackling sensation on moving shoulder in certain positions. There may be stiffness, swelling, loss of movement and tenderness in the front of the shoulder. </p>
<h2> How is a Rotator Cuff Tear diagnosed? </h2>
<p> Your surgeon diagnoses rotator cuff Tear based on a physical examination, X-rays, and imaging studies, such as MRI. Rotator cuff tear is best viewed on magnetic resonance imaging. </p>
<h2> What are the Treatment Options for Rotator Cuff Tears? </h2>
<h3> Conservative treatment options for Rotator Cuff Tears </h3>
<p> The conservative treatment options for rotator cuff tears are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Rest </li>
    <li> Shoulder sling </li>
    <li> Pain medication, injection of a steroid (cortisone) and a local anesthetic in the subacromial space of the affected shoulder to help decrease the inflammation and pain </li>
    <li> Certain exercises </li>
</ul>
<h3> Surgery for Rotator Cuff Tears </h3>
<p> Rotator cuff repair may be performed by open surgery or arthroscopic procedure. In arthroscopy procedure, space for rotator cuff tendons will be increased and the cuff tear is repaired using suture anchors. These anchor sutures help in attaching the tendons to the shoulder bone. Following the surgery, you may be advised to practice motion and strengthening exercises. </p>
<p> <strong>Rotator Cuff Tear </strong> <a href="http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/shoulders/rotator-cuff-tear-t189/video/">http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/shoulders/rotator-cuff-tear-t189/video/</a> <strong></strong> </p>
<h1>Shoulder Instability</h1>
<p> Shoulder instability is a chronic condition that causes frequent dislocations of the shoulder joint. </p>
<h2> Causes of Shoulder Instability </h2>
<p> A dislocation occurs when the end of the humerus (the ball portion) partially or completely dislocates from the glenoid (the socket portion) of the shoulder. A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation whereas a complete separation is referred to as a dislocation. </p>
<h2> Risk Factors of Shoulder Instability </h2>
<p> The risk factors that increase the chances of developing shoulder instability include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Injury or trauma to the shoulder </li>
    <li> Falling on an outstretched hand </li>
    <li> Repetitive overhead sports such as baseball, swimming, volleyball or weightlifting </li>
    <li> Loose shoulder ligaments or an enlarged capsule </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of Shoulder Instability </h2>
<p> The common symptoms of shoulder instability include pain with certain movements of the shoulder; popping or grinding sound may be heard or felt, swelling and bruising of the shoulder may be seen immediately following subluxation or dislocation. Visible deformity and loss of function of the shoulder occurs after subluxation or sensation changes such as numbness or even partial paralysis can occur below the dislocation because of pressure on nerves and blood vessels. </p>
<h2> Treatment Options for Shoulder Instability </h2>
<h3> Conservative Treatments for Shoulder Instability </h3>
<p> The goal of conservative treatment for shoulder instability is to restore stability, strength, and full range of motion. Conservative treatment measures may include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Closed reduction: Following a dislocation, your surgeon can often manipulate the shoulder joint, usually under anesthesia, realigning it into proper position. Surgery may be necessary to restore normal function depending on your condition. </li>
    <li> Medications: Over the counter pain medications and NSAIDs can help reduce the pain and swelling. Steroidal injections may also be administered to decrease swelling. </li>
    <li> Rest: Rest the injured shoulder and avoid activities that require overhead motion. A sling may be worn for 2 weeks to facilitate healing. </li>
    <li> Ice: Ice packs should be applied to the affected area for 20 minutes every hour. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Surgery for Shoulder Instability </h3>
<p> When the conservative treatment options fail to relieve shoulder instability, your surgeon may recommend shoulder stabilization surgery. Shoulder stabilization surgery is done to improve stability and function to the shoulder joint and prevent recurrent dislocations. It can be performed arthroscopically, depending on your condition, with much smaller incisions. Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure in which an arthroscope, a small flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end, is inserted into a joint to evaluate and treat the condition. The benefits of arthroscopy compared to the alternative, open shoulder surgery, are smaller incisions, minimal soft tissue trauma, less pain leading to faster recovery. </p>

<h1>Shoulder Labrum Tear</h1>
<p> The shoulder joint is a "ball and socket" joint that enables smooth gliding and thereby the movements of arms. However, it is inherently unstable because of the shallow socket. A soft rim of cartilage, the labrum, lines the socket and deepens it so that it accommodates the head of the upper arm bone better. </p>
<h2> Causes of Shoulder Labral Tear </h2>
<p> Traumatic injury to the shoulder or overuse of shoulder (throwing, weightlifting) may cause labral tear. In addition, ageing may weaken the labrum leading to injury. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Shoulder Labral Tear </h2>
<p> Shoulder labral tear injury may cause symptoms such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Pain </li>
    <li> Catching or locking sensation </li>
    <li> Decreased range of motion </li>
    <li> Joint instability </li>
</ul>
<h2> Treatments for Shoulder Labral Tear </h2>
<p> Your doctor may start with conservative approaches such as prescribing anti-inflammatory medications and advise rest to relieve symptoms until diagnostic scans are done. Rehabilitation exercises may be recommended to strengthen rotator cuff muscles. If the symptoms do not resolve with these conservative measures, your doctor may recommend arthroscopic surgery. </p>
<p> During arthroscopic surgery, your surgeon examines the labrum and the biceps tendon. If the damage is confined to the labrum without involving the tendon, then the torn flap of the labrum will be removed. In cases where the tendon is also involved or if there is detachment of the tendon, absorbable wires or sutures will be used to repair and reattach the tendon. After the surgery, you will be given a shoulder sling to wear for 3-4 weeks. You will be advised motion and flexibility exercises after the sling is removed. These exercises increase the range of motion and flexibility of the shoulder joint. </p>
<h1>Arthritis of the Shoulder</h1>
<h2> What is Arthritis of the Shoulder? </h2>
<p> The term arthritis literally means inflammation of a joint but is generally used to describe any condition in which there is damage to the cartilage. Damage of the cartilage in the shoulder joint causes shoulder arthritis. Inflammation is the body's natural response to injury. The warning signs that inflammation presents are redness, swelling, heat and pain. </p>
<p> The cartilage is a padding that absorbs stress. The proportion of cartilage damage and synovial inflammation varies with the type and stage of arthritis. Usually the pain early on is due to inflammation. In the later stages, when the cartilage is worn away, most of the pain comes from the mechanical friction of raw bones rubbing on each other. </p>
<h2> What are the Types of Shoulder Arthritis? </h2>
<p> There are over 100 different types of rheumatic diseases. The most common are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<h3> Osteoarthritis </h3>
<p> Osteoarthritis is also called as degenerative joint disease; this is the most common type of arthritis, which occurs often in older people. This disease affects cartilage, the tissue that cushions and protects the ends of bones in a joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage starts to wear away over time. In extreme cases, the cartilage can completely wear away, leaving nothing to protect the bones in a joint, causing bone-on-bone contact. Bones may also bulge, or stick out at the end of a joint, called bone spurs. </p>
<p> Osteoarthritis causes joint pain and can limit a person's normal range of motion (the ability to freely move and bend a joint). When severe, the shoulder joint may lose all movement, making a person disabled. </p>
<h3> Rheumatoid Arthritis </h3>
<p> This is an auto-immune disease in which the body's immune system (the body's way of fighting infection) attacks healthy joints, tissues and organs. Occurring most often in women of child-bearing age (15-44), this disease inflames the lining (or synovium) of joints. It can cause pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of function in joints. When severe, rheumatoid arthritis can deform, or change a joint. </p>
<p> Rheumatoid arthritis affects mostly joints of the hands and feet and tends to be symmetrical. This means the disease affects the same joints on both sides of the body (both hands or both feet) at the same time and with the same symptoms. No other form of arthritis is symmetrical. About two to three times as many women as men have this disease. </p>
<h2> Causes of Shoulder Arthritis </h2>
<p> Osteoarthritis is caused by the wearing out of the cartilage covering the bone ends in a joint. This may be due to excessive strain over prolonged periods of time, or due to other joint diseases, injury or deformity. Primary osteoarthritis is commonly associated with ageing and general degeneration of joints. </p>
<p> Secondary osteoarthritis is generally the consequence of another disease or condition, such as repeated trauma or surgery to the affected joint, or abnormal joint structures from birth. </p>
<p> Rheumatoid arthritis is often caused when the genes responsible for the disease is triggered by infection or any environmental factors. With this trigger, the body produces antibodies, the defense mechanism of the body, against the joint and may cause rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Shoulder Arthritis </h2>
<p> There are several forms of arthritis and the symptoms vary according to the form of arthritis. Each form affects the body differently. Arthritic symptoms generally include swelling and pain or tenderness in the joints for more than two weeks, redness or heat in a joint, limitation of motion of a joint and early morning stiffness. </p>
<p> In an arthritic shoulder: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The cartilage lining is thinner than normal or completely absent. The degree of cartilage damage and inflammation varies with the type and stage of arthritis. </li>
    <li> The capsule of the arthritic shoulder is swollen. </li>
    <li> The joint space is narrowed and irregular in outline; this can be seen in an X-ray image. </li>
    <li> Bone spurs or excessive bone can also build up around the edges of the joint. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis of Shoulder Arthritis </h2>
<p> Doctors diagnose arthritis with a medical history, a physical exam and X-rays of the affected part. Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are also performed to diagnose arthritis. </p>
<h2>Treatment Options for Shoulder Arthritis</h2>
<p> There is no cure for arthritis, so beware of 'miracle cures'. Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medicine. He/she may recommend occupational therapy or physiotherapy, which includes exercises and heat treatment. In severe cases, surgery may be suggested. The type of surgery will depend on your age and severity of the condition. In the elderly with severe arthritis, joint replacement can give good results. Common surgery for treatment of shoulder arthritis arthroplasty (replacement of the damaged joint) may be total shoulder arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty. </p>
<h1>Elbow</h1>
<h1>Elbow Anatomy</h1>
<p> The elbow is a complex joint formed by the articulation of three bones –the humerus, radius and ulna. The elbow joint helps in bending or straightening of the arm to 180 degrees and assists in lifting or moving objects. </p>
<p> The bones of the elbow are supported by: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Ligaments and tendons </li>
    <li> Muscles </li>
    <li> Nerves </li>
    <li> Blood vessels </li>
</ul>
<h2> Bones and Joints of the elbow joint: </h2>
<p> The elbow joint is formed at the junction of three bones: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The Humerus (upper arm bone) forms the upper portion of the joint. The lower end of the humerus divides in to two bony protrusions known as the medial and lateral epicondyles which can be felt on either side of the elbow joint. </li>
    <li> The Ulna is the larger bone of the forearm located on the inner surface of the joint. The curved shape of the ulna articulates with the humerus. </li>
    <li> The Radius is the smaller bone of the forearm situated on the outer surface of the joint. The head of the radius is circular and hollow which allows movement with the humerus. The connection between the ulna and radius helps the forearm to rotate. </li>
</ul>
<p> The elbow consists of three joints because of articulation of the three bones namely: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Humero-ulnar joint is formed between the humerus and ulna and allows flexion and extension of the arm. </li>
    <li> Humero-radial joint is formed between the radius and humerus, and allows movements like flexion, extension, supination and pronation. </li>
    <li> Radio-ulnar joint is formed between the ulna and radius bones, and allows rotation of the lower arm. </li>
</ul>
<p> Articular cartilage lines the articulating regions of the humerus, radius and ulna. It is a thin, tough, flexible, and slippery surface that acts as a shock absorber and cushion to reduce friction between the bones. The cartilage is lubricated by synovial fluid, which further enables the smooth movement of the bones. </p>
<h2> Muscles of the Elbow Joint </h2>
<p> There are several muscles extending across the elbow joint that help in various movements. These include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Biceps brachii: upper arm muscle enabling flexion of the arm </li>
    <li> Triceps brachii: muscle in the back of the upper arm that extends the arm and fixes the elbow during fine movements </li>
    <li> Brachialis: upper arm muscle beneath the biceps which flexes the elbow towards the body </li>
    <li> Brachioradialis: forearm muscle that flexes, straightens and pulls the arm at the elbow </li>
    <li> Pronator teres: this muscle extends from the humeral head, across the elbow, and towards the ulna, and helps to turn the palm facing backward </li>
    <li> Extensor carpi radialis brevis: forearm muscle that helps in movement of the hand </li>
    <li> Extensor digitorum: forearm muscle that helps in movement of the fingers </li>
</ul>
<h2> Elbow joint ligaments and tendons: </h2>
<p> The elbow joint is supported by ligaments and tendons, which provide stability to the joint. </p>
<p> Ligaments are a group of firm tissues that connect bones to other bones. The most important ligaments of the elbow joint are the: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Medial or ulnar collateral ligament: comprised of triangular bands of tissue on the inner side of the elbow joint. </li>
    <li> Lateral or radial collateral ligament: a thin band of tissue on the outer side of the elbow joint. </li>
</ul>
<p> Together, the medial and lateral ligaments are the main source of stability and hold the humerus and ulna tightly in place during movement of the arm. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Annular ligament: It is a group of fibers that surrounds the radial head, and holds the ulna and radius tightly in place during movement of the arm. </li>
</ul>
<p> The ligaments around a joint combine to form a joint capsule that contains synovial fluid. </p>
<p> Any injury to these ligaments can lead to instability of the elbow joint. </p>
<p> Tendons are bands of connective tissue fibers that connect muscle to bone. The various tendons which surround the elbow joint include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Biceps tendon: attaches the biceps muscle to the radius, allowing the elbow to bend </li>
    <li> Triceps tendon: attaches the triceps muscle to the ulna, allowing the elbow to straighten </li>
</ul>
<h2> Nerves of the elbow joint: </h2>
<p> The main nerves of the elbow joint are the ulnar, radial and median nerves. These nerves transfer signals from the brain to the muscles that aid in elbow movements. They also carry the sensory signals like touch, pain, and temperature back to the brain. </p>
<p> Any injury or damage to these nerves causes pain, weakness or joint instability. </p>
<h2> Blood vessels : </h2>
<p> Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-pure blood from the heart to the hand. The main artery of the elbow is the brachial artery that travels across the inside of the elbow and divides into two small branches below the elbow to form the ulnar and the radial artery. </p>

<h1>Tennis Elbow</h1>
<h2> What is Tennis Elbow? </h2>
<p> Tennis elbow is the common name used for the elbow condition called lateral epicondylitis. It is an overuse injury that causes inflammation of the tendons that attach to the bony prominence on the outside of the elbow (lateral epicondyle). It is a painful condition occurring from repeated muscle contractions at the forearm that leads to inflammation and micro tears in the tendons that attach to the lateral epicondyle. The condition is more common in sports activities such as tennis, painting, hammering, typing, gardening and playing musical instruments. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Tennis Elbow </h2>
<p> Patients with tennis elbow experience elbow pain or burning that gradually worsens and a weakened grip </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Tennis Elbow </h2>
<p> Your doctor will evaluate tennis elbow by reviewing your medical history, performing a thorough physical examination and ordering X-rays, MRI or electromyogram (EMG) to detect any nerve compression. </p>
<h2> Treatments of Tennis Elbow </h2>
<p> Your doctor will first recommend conservative treatment options to treat the tennis elbow symptoms. These may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Limit use and rest the arm from activities that worsen symptoms. </li>
    <li> Splints or braces may be ordered to decrease stress on the injured tissues. </li>
    <li> Apply ice packs on the elbow to reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> Avoid activities that bring on the symptoms and increase stress on the tendons. </li>
    <li> Anti-inflammatory medications and/or steroid injections may be ordered to treat pain and swelling. </li>
    <li> Physical therapy may be ordered for strengthening and stretching exercises to the forearm once your symptoms have decreased. </li>
    <li> Pulsed ultrasound may be utilized to increase blood flow and promote healing to the injured tendons. </li>
</ul>
<p> If conservative treatment options fail to resolve the condition and symptoms persist for 6 -12 months, your surgeon may recommend a surgical procedure to treat tennis elbow called lateral epicondyle release surgery. Your surgeon will decide whether to perform your surgery in the traditional open manner (single large incision) or endoscopically (2 to 3 tiny incisions and the use of an endoscope –narrow lighted tube with a camera). Your surgeon will decide which option is best for you depending on your specific circumstances. </p>
<p> Your surgeon moves aside soft tissue to view the extensor tendon and its attachment on the lateral epicondyle. The surgeon then trims the tendon or releases the tendon and then reattaches it to the bone. Any scar tissue present will be removed as well as any bone spurs. After the surgery is completed, the incision(s) are closed by suturing or by tape. </p>
<p> Following surgery, you are referred to physical therapy to improve the range of motion and strength of your joint. </p>

<h1>Golfer's Elbow</h1>
<h2> What is Golfer's Elbow? </h2>
<p> Golfer's elbow, also called medial epicondylitis, is a painful condition occurring from repeated muscle contractions in the forearm that leads to inflammation and microtears in the tendons that attach to the medial epicondyle. The medial epicondyle is the bony prominence that is felt on the inside of the elbow. </p>
<p> Golfer's elbow and tennis elbow are similar, except that golfer's elbow occurs on the inside of the elbow and tennis elbow occurs on the outside of the elbow. Both conditions are a type of tendonitis, which literally means "inflammation of the tendons". </p>
<h2> Signs and Symptoms of Golfer's Elbow </h2>
<p> Signs and symptoms of golfer's elbow can include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Elbow pain that appears suddenly or gradually </li>
    <li> Achy pain to the inner side of the elbow during activity </li>
    <li> Elbow stiffness with decreased range of motion </li>
    <li> Pain that radiates to the inner forearm, hand or wrist </li>
    <li> Weakened grip </li>
    <li> Pain worsens with gripping objects </li>
    <li> Pain is exacerbated in the elbow when the wrist is flexed or bent forward toward the forearm </li>
</ul>
<h2> Causes of Golfer's Elbow </h2>
<p> Golfer's elbow is usually caused by overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons that control wrist and finger movement, but may also be caused by direct trauma such as with a fall, car accident or work injury. </p>
<p> Golfer's elbow is commonly seen in golfers; hence the name, especially when poor technique or unsuitable equipment is used when hitting the ball. Other common causes include any activity that requires repetitive motion of the forearm such as: painting, hammering, typing, raking, pitching sports, gardening, shoveling, fencing and playing golf. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Golfer's Elbow </h2>
<p> Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a thorough physical examination of your elbow joint. Your physician may order an X-ray to rule out a fracture or arthritis as the cause of your pain. Occasionally, if the diagnosis is unclear, further tests such as MRI, ultrasonography and injection test may be ordered to confirm golfer's elbow. </p>
<h2> Treatment Options for Golfer's Elbow </h2>
<h3> Conservative Treatment Options for Golfer's Elbow </h3>
<p> Your physician will recommend conservative treatment options to treat the symptoms associated with golfer's elbow. These may include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Activity restrictions:</strong> Limit the use and rest your arm from activities that worsen symptoms. </li>
    <li> <strong>Orthotics:</strong> Splints or braces may be ordered to decrease stress on the injured tissues. </li>
    <li> <strong>Ice:</strong> Ice packs applied to the injury will help reduce swelling and pain. Ice should be applied over a towel to the affected area for 20 minutes, four times a day for a couple of days. Never place ice directly over the skin. </li>
    <li> <strong>Medications:</strong> Anti-inflammatory medications and/or steroid injections may be ordered to treat the pain and swelling. </li>
    <li> <strong>Occupational therapy:</strong> OT may be ordered for strengthening and stretching exercises to the forearm, once your symptoms have decreased. </li>
    <li> <strong>Pulsed ultrasound:</strong> This is a treatment used by therapists to break up scar tissue and increase blood flow to the injured tendons to promote healing. </li>
    <li> <strong>Professional instruction:</strong> Consulting a sports professional to assess and instruct in proper swing technique and appropriate equipment may be recommended to prevent recurrence. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Surgery for Golfer's Elbow </h3>
<p> If conservative treatment options fail to resolve the condition and symptoms persist for 6 -12 months, your surgeon may recommend surgery to treat golfer's elbow. The goal of surgery is to remove the diseased tissue around the inner elbow, improve blood supply to the area to promote healing, and alleviate the symptoms. </p>

<h1>Hand & Wrist</h1>
<h1>Hand& Wrist Anatomy</h1>
<p> The human hand is made up of the wrist, palm, and fingers and consists of 27 bones, 27 joints, 34 muscles, over 100 ligaments and tendons, and many blood vessels and nerves. </p>
<p> The hands enable us to perform many of our daily activities such as driving, writing and cooking. It is important to understand the normal anatomy of the hand to learn more about diseases and conditions that can affect our hands. </p>
<h2> Bones </h2>
<p> The wrist is comprised of 8 carpal bones. These wrist bones are attached to the radius and ulna of the forearm to form the wrist joint. They connect to 5 metacarpal bones that form the palm of the hand. Each metacarpal bone connects to one finger at a joint called the metacarpophalangeal joint or MCP joint. This joint is also commonly referred to as the knuckle joint. </p>
<p> The bones in our fingers and thumb are called phalanges. Each finger has 3 phalanges separated by two interphalangeal joints, except for the thumb, which has only 2 phalanges and one interphalangeal joint. </p>
<p> The first joint close to the knuckle joint is called the proximal interphalangeal joint or PIP joint. The joint closest to the end of the finger is called the distal interphalangeal joint or DIP joint. </p>
<p> The MCP joint and the PIP joint act like hinges when the fingers bend and straighten. </p>
<h2> Soft tissues </h2>
<p> Our hand bones are held in place and supported by various soft tissues. These include: articular cartilage, ligaments, muscles and tendons. </p>
<p> Articular cartilages are smooth material that act as shock absorbers and cushion the ends of bones at each of the 27 joints, allowing smooth movement of the hand. </p>
<p> Muscles and ligaments function to control the movement of the hand. </p>
<p> Ligaments are tough rope-like tissues that connect bones to other bones, holding them in place and providing stability to the joints. Each finger joint has two collateral ligaments on either side, which prevents the abnormal sideways bending of the joints. The volar plate is the strongest ligament in the hand. It joins the proximal and middle phalanx on the palm side of the joint and prevents backwards bending of the PIP joint (hyperextension). </p>
<h2> Muscles </h2>
<p> Muscles are fibrous tissues that help produce movement. Muscles work by contracting. </p>
<p> There are two types of muscles in the hand, intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. </p>
<p> Intrinsic muscles are small muscles that originate in the wrist and hand. They are responsible for fine motor movement of the fingers during activities such as writing or playing the piano. </p>
<p> Extrinsic muscles originate in the forearm or elbow and control the movement of the wrist and hand. These muscles are responsible for gross hand movements. They position the wrist and hand while the fingers perform fine motor movements. </p>
<p> Each finger has six muscles controlling its movement: three extrinsic and three intrinsic muscles. The index and little finger each have an extra extrinsic extensor. </p>
<h2> Tendons </h2>
<p> Tendons are soft tissues that connect muscles to bones. When muscles contract, tendons pull the bones causing the finger to move. The extrinsic muscles are attached to finger bones through long tendons that extend from the forearm through the wrist. Tendons located on the palm side help in bending the fingers and are called flexor tendons, while tendons on top of the hand help in straightening the fingers, and are called extensor tendons. </p>
<h2> Nerves </h2>
<p> Nerves of the hand carry electrical signals from the brain to the muscles in the forearm and hand, enabling movement. They also carry the senses of touch, pain and temperature back from the hands to the brain. </p>
<p> The three main nerves of the hand and wrist are the ulnar nerve, radial nerve and median nerve. All three nerves originate at the shoulder and travel down the arm to the hand. Each of these nerves has sensory and motor components. </p>
<p> <strong>Ulnar Nerve</strong> : The ulnar nerve crosses the wrist through an area called Guyon's canal and branches to provide sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger. </p>
<p> <strong>Median Nerve</strong> : The median nerve crosses the wrist through a tunnel called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve provides sensation to the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger. </p>
<p> <strong>Radial Nerve</strong> : The radial nerve runs down the thumb side of the forearm and provides sensation to the back of the hand from the thumb to the middle finger. </p>
<h2> Blood Vessels </h2>
<p> Blood vessels travel beside the nerves to supply blood to the hand. The main arteries are the ulnar and radial arteries, which supply blood to the front of the hand, fingers, and thumb. </p>
<p> The ulnar artery travels next to the ulnar nerve through the Guyon's canal in the wrist. </p>
<p> The radial artery is the largest artery of the hand, traveling across the front of the wrist, near the thumb. Pulse is measured at the radial artery. </p>
<p> Other blood vessels travel across the back of the wrist to supply blood to the back of the hand, fingers and thumb. </p>
<h2> Bursae </h2>
<p> Bursae are small fluid- filled sacs that decrease friction between tendons and bone or skin. Bursae contain special cells called synovial cells that secrete a lubricating fluid. </p>

<h1>Wrist Fracture</h1>
<p> The wrist is comprised of two bones in the forearm, the radius and ulna, and eight tiny carpal bones in the palm. The bones meet to form multiple large and small joints. A wrist fracture refers to a break in one or more of these bones. </p>
<p> Types of wrist fracture include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Simple wrist fractures in which the fractured pieces of bone are well aligned and stable. </li>
    <li> Unstable fractures are those in which fragments of the broken bone are misaligned and displaced. </li>
    <li> Open (compound) wrist fractures are severe fractures in which the broken bones cut through the skin. This type of fracture is more prone to infection and requires immediate medical attention. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Causes </h2>
<p> Wrist fractures may be caused due to a fall on an outstretched arm, vehicular accidents or workplace injuries. Certain sports such as football, snowboarding, or soccer may also be a cause of wrist fractures. Wrist fractures are more common in people with osteoporosis, a condition marked by brittleness of the bones. </p>
<h2> Signs and Symptoms </h2>
<p> Common symptoms of a wrist fracture include severe pain, swelling, and limited movement of the hand and wrist. Other symptoms include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Deformed or crooked wrist </li>
    <li> Bruising </li>
    <li> Numbness </li>
    <li> Stiffness </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis </h2>
<p> Your doctor performs a preliminary physical examination followed by imaging tests such as an X-ray of the wrist to diagnose a fracture and check alignment of the bones. Sometimes a CT scan may be ordered to gather more details of the fracture, such as soft tissue, nerves or blood vessel injury. MRI may be performed to identify tiny fractures and ligament injuries. </p>
<p> Your doctor will order a bone scan to identify stress fractures due to repeated trauma. The radioactive substance injected into the blood gets collected in areas where the bone is healing and is detected with a scanner. </p>
<h2> Treatment </h2>
<p> Your doctor may prescribe analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications to relieve pain and inflammation. </p>
<p> Fractures that are not displaced are treated with either a splint or a cast to hold the wrist in place. </p>
<p> If the wrist bones are displaced, your surgeon may perform fracture reduction to align the bones. This is performed under local anesthesia. A splint or a cast is then placed to support the wrist and allow healing. </p>
<h2> Surgery </h2>
<p> Surgery is recommended to treat severely displaced wrist fractures and is carried out under the effect of general anesthesia. </p>
<p> External fixation, such as pins may be used to treat the fracture from the outside. These pins are fixed above and below the fracture site and are held in place by an external frame outside the wrist. </p>
<p> Internal fixation may be recommended to maintain the bones in proper position while they heal. Devices such as rods, plates and screws may be implanted at the fracture site. </p>
<p> Crushed or missing bone may be treated by using bone grafts taken from another part of your body, bone bank or using a bone graft substitute. </p>
<p> During the healing period, you may be asked to perform some motion exercises to keep your wrist flexible. Your doctor may recommend hand rehabilitation therapy or physical therapy to improve function, strength and reduce stiffness. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications </h2>
<p> As with any procedure, wrist fracture surgery involves certain risks and complications. They include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Residual joint stiffness </li>
    <li> Arthritis </li>
</ul>
<p> Wrist Fracture <a href="http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/hand-wrist/wrist-fracture-t154/video/">http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/hand-wrist/wrist-fracture-t154/video/</a> </p>
<h1>Wrist Sprain</h1>
<p> Injuries caused due to stretching or tearing of the ligaments in the wrist are called wrist sprains. These injuries are usually caused by a fall during daily activities or sports activities. Sprains can range from mild to severe based on the extent of injury to the ligament. Some of the main symptoms of wrist sprains include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Swelling and pain in the wrist </li>
    <li> Difficulty in moving the wrist </li>
    <li> Bruising around the wrist </li>
    <li> Popping sensation inside the wrist </li>
    <li> A feeling of warmth or feverishness in the wrist </li>
</ul>
<p> Your doctor diagnoses this condition with the help of your medical history and physical examination of your wrist. Your doctor may also use imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans and MRI to diagnose partial ligament tears. </p>
<p> Treatment for wrist sprains includes surgical and non-surgical treatments. Non-surgical treatment involves immobilization of the wrist and performing strengthening exercises once the pain has reduced. Surgical treatment is used to repair the ligament if it is completely torn. </p>
<h1>Flexor Tendon Injuries</h1>
<p> Tendons are the bands of fibrous connective tissue that connect muscles to bone. Tendons aid in movement of the fingers, hand and all other body parts. </p>
<p> There are two types of tendons present in the hand- extensor tendons and flexor tendons. Extensor tendons present on top of the hand help with straightening the fingers, whereas, flexor tendons that lie on the palm side of the hand help in bending the fingers. The flexor tendons are smooth, flexible, thick tissue strands which bend the fingers. </p>
<p> Deep cuts on the under surface of the wrist, hand, or fingers can cut and injure the tendon and make it unable to bend one or more joints in a finger. When a tendon is cut, it acts like a rubber band, where the cut ends are pulled away from each other. </p>
<p> Flexor tendon tears may be partial or complete. If tendons are completely cut through, the finger joints cannot bend on their own at all. </p>
<h2> Causes </h2>
<p> Any cut or laceration to the arm, hand or fingers can cause a flexor tendon injury. Other possible causes include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Damage to the tendon from -a sports injury, often associated with football, rugby and wrestling </li>
    <li> Stretching of the tendon where the tendon is pulled off the bone </li>
    <li> Jersey finger: When a player's finger catches on another player's jersey or clothing </li>
    <li> Rheumatoid arthritis </li>
    <li> Adventurous activities such as rock climbing </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms </h2>
<p> Inform your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Recent cut to hand or fingers </li>
    <li> Pain </li>
    <li> Swelling </li>
    <li> Loss of ability to bend the finger </li>
    <li> Numbness (loss of sensation) </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis </h2>
<p> Make sure to see a doctor when you sustain a finger injury that is affecting the flexion and extension of your fingers. </p>
<p> First Aid: Apply ice immediately to the injured finger. Wrap a sterile cloth or bandage around the injury and keep your finger elevated above your heart level to reduce bleeding if present. A tetanus injection may need to be administered. </p>
<p> Your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. A physical examination will be done, which includes a complete examination of both hands. During the examination, you will be asked to bend and straighten your fingers. Your fingers will also be checked for sensation, blood flow and strength. An X-ray may be ordered to check for any damage to the surrounding bone. </p>
<h2> Treatment </h2>
<p> A ruptured tendon cannot heal without surgery because the cut ends usually pull away after an injury. </p>
<p> There are many options to repair a cut tendon; the type of repair depends on the type of cut. The aim of the procedure is to restore normal function of the joints and surrounding tissues following a tendon laceration. </p>
<p> The flexor tendon repair is usually an outpatient procedure and can be performed under local or general anesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision on the skin over the injured tendon. The damaged ends of the tendon are brought together with sutures to achieve a secure repair. If the tendon injury is severe, a graft may be required. A graft is a piece of tendon that is derived from other parts of the body such as a foot or toe. After the repositioning of the tendon, the incisions are closed with sutures and a dressing pad is placed over the surgical site. Your surgeon will place your hand in a protective splint to restrict movements. </p>
<p> Depending on the injury, you will be advised to start hand therapy for a few weeks following surgery. This is to improve the movement of the finger. Follow your surgeon's specific instructions for a successful recovery. </p>
<p> Possible complications of surgery include pain, bleeding, infection, stiffness, rupture of the repair, and damage to the surrounding nerves or blood vessels. A second surgery may be needed to release any excess scar tissue that interferes with finger movement. </p>

<h1>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h1>
<p> Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common, painful, progressive condition that is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist area. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome </h2>
<p> Common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness and tingling sensation in all the fingers except the little finger; pain and burning sensation in hand and wrist that may radiate up the arm and elbow; and weakness in hand with diminished grip strength. </p>
<h2> Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome </h2>
<p> Exact causes of the condition are not known. However certain factors increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome and they include congenital abnormalities, repetitive motion of hand and wrists, fractures and sprains, hormonal imbalance, and other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity, gout, overactive pituitary gland, or the presence of a cyst or tumor in the canal.  </p>
<h2> Conservative Treatment Options for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome </h2>
<p> Carpal tunnel syndrome may be treated using conservative approaches or surgery. The conservative treatments include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Treating underlying medical conditions </li>
    <li> Immobilization of the hand and wrist with a splint or wrist brace for 4-6 weeks </li>
    <li> Rest the hand for 2 weeks or more </li>
    <li> Ice packs to avoid swelling </li>
    <li> Avoid activities that tend to worsen the symptoms </li>
    <li> Medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid injections </li>
    <li> Strengthening and stretching exercises once symptoms diminish </li>
</ul>
<h2> Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> If conservative treatment options fail to resolve the condition your surgeon may recommend surgical procedure. </p>
<p> Carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. Traditional surgery involves up to a 2- inch incision in the palm and wrist area, whereas endoscopic surgery involves one or two half-an-inch incisions and the use of an endoscope. During the surgery, the transverse carpal ligament will be dissected to release the pressure on the median nerve and enlarge the carpal tunnel. Your surgeon will decide which options are best for you based on your general and medical conditions. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> Your surgeon may suggest you practice certain Postoperative procedures for better recovery and to avoid further complications. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Elevate the hand above heart level to reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> A splint may be worn </li>
    <li> Ice packs to the surgical area to reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> Keep the surgical incision clean and dry. Cover the area with plastic wrap when bathing or showering. </li>
    <li> Physical therapy may be ordered to restore wrist strength. </li>
    <li> Eating a healthy diet and not smoking will promote healing </li>
</ul>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> Most patients suffer no complications following carpal tunnel release surgery. However, some patients may suffer from pain, infections, scarring, and nerve damage causing weakness, paralysis, or loss of sensation and stiffness in the hand and wrist area. </p>
<h1>Trigger Finger</h1>
<p> The ability to bend the fingers is governed by supportive tendons that connect muscles to the bones of the fingers. The tendons run along the length of the bone and are kept in place at intervals by tunnels of ligaments called pulleys. When the fingers bend, or are straightened, a slippery coating called tenosynovium helps the tendons smoothly glide through the ligaments with reduced friction. </p>
<p> Inflammation in the tenosynovium leads to a condition called trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis or flexor tendonitis, where one of the fingers or thumb of the hand is caught in a bent position. The affected digit may straighten with a quick snap, like pulling and releasing the trigger on a gun, hence the name trigger finger. </p>
<h2> Causes </h2>
<p> Trigger finger is caused by inflammation of the tenosynovium. Inflammation forms a nodule and makes it difficult for the tendon to glide smoothly within its sheath, causing "catching" of the finger in a bent position and then suddenly releasing the finger straight. </p>
<p> Other causes of trigger finger can include the following: </p>
<p> <strong>Repetitive Motion:</strong> Individuals who perform heavy, repetitive hand and wrist movements with prolonged gripping at work or play are believed to be at high risk of developing trigger finger. </p>
<p> <strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Conditions associated with developing trigger finger include hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and certain infections such as tuberculosis. </p>
<p> <strong>Gender:</strong> Trigger finger is more common in females than males. </p>
<h2> Signs and Symptoms </h2>
<p> Commonly reported symptoms associated with trigger finger include the following: - </p>
<ul>
    <li> Pain and tenderness over the inflamed tendon nodule </li>
    <li> Bent finger suddenly pops out and straightens </li>
    <li> "Popping" or "clicking" sound or sensation when the nodule moves through the pulley </li>
    <li> Finger feels stiff and sore </li>
    <li> Finger gets locked, with inability to straighten when the nodule grows large and gets stuck in the pulley </li>
    <li> Symptoms are worse in the morning </li>
</ul>
<p> Long-term complications of untreated trigger finger can include permanent digit swelling and contracture, as well as tearing of the tendon or rupture. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis </h2>
<p> Hand and wrist conditions should be evaluated by an orthopaedic hand surgeon for proper diagnosis and treatment. Trigger finger is diagnosed based on the medical history and a physical examination and without any special testing required. </p>
<h2> Treatment </h2>
<p> Your surgeon will recommend conservative treatment options to treat trigger finger symptoms. Treatment options will vary depending on the severity of the condition. </p>
<p> Conservative treatment options may include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Treating any underlying medical conditions that may be causing the problem, such as diabetes or arthritis </li>
    <li> Rest the hand for 2-4 weeks or more by avoiding repetitive gripping actions. Avoid activities that tend to bring on the symptoms. </li>
    <li> Strengthening and stretching exercises with the affected finger may be suggested. </li>
    <li> Occupational therapy may be recommended for massage, heat, ice and exercises to improve the finger. </li>
    <li> Ice over the affected finger may help the symptoms. Apply ice over a towel for 5-15 min, 3-4 times daily. </li>
    <li> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help to relieve pain and inflammation. </li>
    <li> Steroid injections into the affected finger may help reduce the inflammation. </li>
</ul>
<p> If conservative treatment options fail to resolve the condition and symptoms persist for 6 months or more and your quality of life is adversely affected, your surgeon may recommend a surgical procedure to release the tendon. </p>
<p> Percutaneous trigger finger release surgery is a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthesia. Your surgeon makes one small incision to the affected finger area, about an inch long, and releases the tight portion of the flexor tendon sheath. </p>

<h1>Hip</h1>
<h1>Hip Anatomy</h1>
<p> The hip joint is the largest weight-bearing joint in the human body. It is also referred to as a ball and socket joint and is surrounded by muscles, ligaments and tendons. The thighbone or femur and the pelvis join to form the hip joint. </p>
<p> Any injury or disease of the hip will adversely affect the joint's range of motion and ability to bear weight. </p>
<p> The hip joint is made up of the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Bones and joints </li>
    <li> Ligaments of the joint capsule </li>
    <li> Muscles and tendons </li>
    <li> Nerves and blood vessels that supply the bones and muscles of the hip </li>
</ul>
<h2> Bones and Joints of the Hip </h2>
<p> The hip joint is the junction where the hip joins the leg to the trunk of the body. It is comprised of two bones: the thighbone or femur, and the pelvis, which is made up of three bones called ilium, ischium and pubis. </p>
<p> The ball of the hip joint is made by the femoral head while the socket is formed by the acetabulum. The acetabulum is a deep, circular socket formed on the outer edge of the pelvis by the union of three bones: ilium, ischium and pubis. The lower part of the ilium is attached by the pubis while the ischium is considerably behind the pubis. The stability of the hip is provided by the joint capsule or acetabulum and the muscles and ligaments that surround and support the hip joint. </p>
<p> The head of the femur rotates and glides within the acetabulum. A fibrocartilaginous lining called the labrum is attached to the acetabulum and further increases the depth of the socket. </p>
<p> The femur is one of the longest bones in the human body. The upper part of the thighbone consists of the femoral head, femoral neck, and greater and lesser trochanters. The head of the femur joins the pelvis (acetabulum) to form the hip joint. Next to the femoral neck, there are two protrusions known as greater and lesser trochanters which serve as sites of muscle attachment. </p>
<p> Articular cartilage is the thin, tough, flexible and slippery surface lubricated by synovial fluid that covers the weight-bearing bones of the body. It enables smooth movements of the bones and reduces friction. </p>
<h2> Ligaments of the Hip Joint </h2>
<p> Ligaments are fibrous structures that connect bones to other bones. The hip joint is encircled with ligaments to provide stability to the hip by forming a dense and fibrous structure around the joint capsule. The ligaments adjoining the hip joint include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Iliofemoral ligament:</strong> This is a Y-shaped ligament that connects the pelvis to the femoral head at the front of the joint. It helps in limiting over-extension of the hip. </li>
    <li> <strong>Pubofemoral ligament:</strong> This is a triangular shaped ligament that extends between the upper portion of the pubis and the iliofemoral ligament. It attaches the pubis to the femoral head. </li>
    <li> <strong>Ischiofemoral ligament:</strong> This is a group of strong fibers that arise from the ischium behind the acetabulum and merge with the fibers of the joint capsule. </li>
    <li> <strong>Ligamentum teres:</strong> This is a small ligament that extends from the tip of the femoral head to the acetabulum. Although it has no role in hip movement, it does have a small artery within that supplies blood to a part of the femoral head. </li>
    <li> <strong>Acetabular labrum:</strong> The labrum is a fibrous cartilage ring which lines the acetabular socket. It deepens the cavity increasing the stability and strength of the hip joint. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Muscles and Tendons of the Hip Joint </h2>
<p> A long tendon called the iliotibial band runs along the femur from the hip to the knee and serves as an attachment site for several hip muscles including the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Gluteal:</strong> These are the muscles that form the buttocks. There are three muscles (gluteus minimus, gluteus maximus, and gluteus medius) that attach to the back of the pelvis and insert into the greater trochanter of the femur. </li>
    <li> <strong>Adductors:</strong> These muscles are in the thighs which help in adduction, the action of pulling the leg back towards the midline. </li>
    <li> <strong>Iliopsoas:</strong> This muscle is in front of the hip joint and provides flexion. It is a deep muscle that originates from the lower back and pelvis, and extends up to the inside surface of the upper part of the femur. </li>
    <li> <strong>Rectus femoris:</strong> This is the largest band of muscles located in front of the thigh. They are also called hip flexors. </li>
    <li> <strong>Hamstring muscles:</strong> These begin at the bottom of the pelvis and run down the back of the thigh. Because they cross the back of the hip joint, they help in extension of the hip by pulling it backwards. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Nerves and Arteries of the Hip Joint </h2>
<p> Nerves of the hip transfer signals from the brain to the muscles to aid in hip movement. They also carry the sensory signals such as touch, pain, and temperature back to the brain. </p>
<p> The main nerves in the hip region include the femoral nerve in the front of the femur and the sciatic nerve at the back. The hip is also supplied by a smaller nerve known as the obturator nerve. </p>
<p> In addition to these nerves, there are blood vessels that supply blood to the lower limbs. The femoral artery, one of the largest arteries in the body, arises deep in the pelvis and can be felt in front of the upper thigh. </p>
<h2> Hip Movements </h2>
<p> All the anatomical parts of the hip work together to enable various movements. <strong></strong> Hip movements include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and hip rotation. </p>

<h1>Hip Pain</h1>
<h2> What is Hip Pain? </h2>
<p> Hip pain, one of the common symptoms that patients complain of, may not always be felt precisely over the hip joint. Pain may be felt in and around the hip joint and the cause for pain is multifactorial. The exact position of your hip pain suggests the probable cause or underlying condition causing pain. Pain felt inside the hip joint or your groin area is more likely to be because of the problems within the hip joint. Likewise, the pain felt on the outer side of your hip, upper thigh or buttocks may be a result of the problems of the muscles, ligaments, tendons and soft tissues surrounding the hip joint. However, certain disease conditions affecting other parts of your body such as lower back or knees also cause hip pain. </p>
<h2> Causes of Hip Pain </h2>
<p> The main cause of sudden pain in the hip is an injury resulting in fracture of the hip bone. Hip fractures are common in elderly individuals because the bones wear out as age advances. Other causes of hip pain may be: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Arthritis </li>
    <li> Bursitis </li>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Low back pain </li>
    <li> Osteonecrosis of the hip </li>
    <li> Sprains or strains </li>
    <li> Tendinitis resulting from repetitive use </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis of Hip Pain </h2>
<p> Your doctor will evaluate your condition based on the medical history, a physical examination of the hip and thigh region, and diagnostic tests including X-rays and other scans. </p>
<h2> Treatments for Hip Pain </h2>
<p> Self-care and pain-relieving anti-inflammatory medications offer symptomatic relief. However, the exact cause for the pain needs to be addressed. Practicing certain measures can avoid aggravation of pain and improve the quality of life. Avoiding physical activities that may worsen the pain, stretching the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, performing warm up exercises before actual exercise regimen improve the condition. Applying ice packs over the region of pain for about 15 minutes three to four times daily reduces both pain and swelling. But if you have an injury with severe hip pain and swelling, talk to your orthopaedic surgeon immediately for better treatment outcomes. </p>

<p> Osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of arthritis. It occurs most often in older people. This disease affects the tissue covering the ends of bones in a joint (cartilage). In a person with osteoarthritis, the cartilage becomes damaged and worn out causing pain, swelling, stiffness and restricted movement in the affected joint. Although osteoarthritis may affect various joints including hips, knees, hands, and spine, hip joint is most commonly affected. Rarely, the disease may affect the shoulders, wrists and feet. </p>
<h2> Causes of Osteoarthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> Osteoarthritis is characterized by damaged articular cartilage, cartilage lining the hip joint. Advanced age is one of the most common reasons for osteoarthritis of the hip. You may also develop osteoarthritis if you had a hip injury or fracture in the past, if you have family history of osteoarthritis, suffering from hip diseases such as avascular necrosis and other congenital or developmental hip diseases. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Osteoarthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> The characteristic symptoms and diagnostic test help in diagnosing the condition. You will experience severe pain confined to hip and thighs, morning stiffness and limited range of motion. Based on the symptoms, your orthopaedic surgeon will perform a physical examination, X-rays and other scans, and some blood tests to rule out the other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. </p>
<h2> Management of Osteoarthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> There are several treatments and lifestyle modifications that can help you ease your pain and symptoms. </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Medications:</strong> Pain-relieving medications such as NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and opioids may be prescribed. Topical medications such as ointments can be applied over the skin where there is pain. If the pain is very severe, corticosteroid injection can be given directly into the affected joint to ease the pain. </li>
    <li> <strong>Other treatments:</strong> Your physiotherapist will teach you exercises to keep joints flexible and improve muscle strength. Heat/cold therapy which involves applying heat or cold packs to the joints provides temporary pain relief. Lifestyle modifications can be done to control weight and avoid extra stress on the weight-bearing joints. </li>
    <li> <strong>Surgery:</strong> Hip joint replacement surgery is considered as an option when the pain is so severe that it affects your ability to carry out normal activities. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip</h1>
<h2> What is Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip? </h2>
<p> Inflammation of the joints is referred to as arthritis. The inflammation arises when the smooth covering (cartilage) at the end surfaces of the bones wears away. In some cases, the inflammation is caused when the lining of the joint becomes inflamed as part of an underlying systemic disease. These conditions are referred to as inflammatory arthritis. </p>
<h2> Types of Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> The most common types of inflammatory arthritic conditions of the hip include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong> systemic disease of the immune system commonly affects multiple joints on both sides of the body at the same time. </li>
    <li> <strong>Ankylosing spondylitis:</strong> chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and the sacroiliac joints (junction where the spine meets the pelvic bone). </li>
    <li> <strong>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE):</strong> an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy cells and tissues. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> The typical symptom of arthritis is joint pain. Inflammatory hip arthritis is mainly characterized by an aching pain in the groin region, outer thighs or buttocks. The pain is commonly most severe in the morning which sometimes lessens with activity during the day. Vigorous activities may result in increased pain and stiffness and limit your movement making walking difficult. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> Inflammatory hip arthritis can be diagnosed by a physical examination. Your doctor will ask you to move your hip in different directions to find out which motions are restricted or painful. X-rays and laboratory tests may be ordered to diagnose or rule out other conditions. X-rays may show thinning or erosion in the bones or loss in joint space. Laboratory studies will show the presence of a rheumatoid factor or other antibodies. </p>
<h2> Treatments for Inflammatory Arthritis of the Hip </h2>
<p> The treatment options vary depending on the diagnosis. </p>
<p> <strong>Non-surgical treatment</strong> : Any infection in the hip joint is treated by non-surgical treatments which may provide relief with relatively few side effects. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Anti-inflammatory medications or corticosteroids may help reduce the inflammation. </li>
    <li> Physical therapy may be recommended to help you increase the range of motion and strengthening exercises to maintain muscle tone. </li>
    <li> Assistive devices such as canes or walkers can make your daily living activities easier. </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Surgical treatment</strong> : Surgery is considered the last treatment resort when the above non-surgical treatment options fail to reduce the symptoms. The type of surgery to be performed depends on your age, condition of the hip joint, and the type and progression of the inflammatory disease. The goal of the surgery is to relieve pain and improve the joint motion. The most common surgical procedures include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Total hip replacement: Indicated for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. </li>
    <li> Bone grafts: Recommended for patients with SLE. These grafts aim to build new blood cells to replace the old dead cells. </li>
    <li> Core decompression: Helps to reduce bone marrow pressure and encourages blood flow. Core decompression is another treatment option for patients with SLE. </li>
    <li> Synovectomy is the procedure of removal of a part or whole of the joint lining. This is indicated if the inflammation has not affected the cartilage but is limited to the joint lining or synovium. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip</h1>
<h2> What is Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip? </h2>
<p> Transient osteoporosis of the hip is a rare condition that causes bone loss temporarily in the upper part of the thighbone (femur). It is mostly found in young or middle-aged men between the ages of 30 and 60, and women in their later stages of pregnancy or early postpartum period (following childbirth). It is characterized by abrupt onset of pain that increases with activity. </p>
<p> The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint. A part of the pelvis bone known as the acetabulum forms the socket and the upper end of the femur, known as the femoral head, forms the ball. In patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip, the femoral head loses its density and strength and becomes more prone to breaking. </p>
<h2> Causes of Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip </h2>
<p> An exact cause is unknown. Some of the proposed causes include atypical mechanical stresses acting on the hip joint, hormonal abnormalities, and blockage of some of the small blood vessels surrounding the hip joint. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip </h2>
<p> Symptoms may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Unknown pain in the hip not triggered by any previous accident or injury </li>
    <li> Abrupt onset of pain in the anterior thigh, the side of the hip, groin or buttocks </li>
    <li> Pain that increases with activities or weight-bearing and decreases with rest </li>
    <li> Intense pain with extreme hip range of motion </li>
    <li> Gradually increasing pain that becomes disabling over a few weeks or months </li>
    <li> A prominent limp </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis of Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip </h2>
<p> Diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip often begins with a history and a physical examination. Your doctor may ask you questions related to your general health and any previous accidents or injuries. You will be asked to perform various range-of-motion exercises to replicate your pain. Most patients experience acute pain with weight-bearing and active range of motion and minimal pain when the doctor moves the hip for them (passive range of motion). This is one of the indicators in the diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip. </p>
<p> You will also be recommended to undergo imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, or nuclear scans to further document transient osteoporosis of your hip. </p>
<p> Most patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip are found to have bone marrow edema. Bone marrow edema is a condition where fluid builds up in the bone marrow (spongy material located in the hollow of the long bones) and the bone marrow becomes inflamed. MRI scans have been found to be particularly beneficial in documenting bone marrow edema and are one of the most practicable studies in the diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip. </p>
<h2> Treatments for Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip </h2>
<p> Transient osteoporosis of the hip resolves on its own and treatment involves preventing any damage to the weakened bones and minimizing the symptoms and discomfort. Treatments include: </p>
<p> <strong>Medication</strong> : Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications or NSAIDs may be recommended to alleviate inflammation and pain </p>
<p> <strong>Restricted weight-bearing:</strong> You may be recommended to restrict or to completely avoid putting weight on your hip joint. You may need to use walking aids such as crutches, cane or a walker to limit the stress on your hip bone. </p>
<p> <strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Your doctor may instruct you on special exercises to help strengthen the muscles supporting your hip. Water exercises have been found to be helpful as they ease movement and relieve weight-bearing. </p>
<p> <strong>Nutrition</strong> : Vitamin D and calcium have been found to be effective in healing and rebuilding of bones. Your doctor will recommend foods or supplements that can help you recover faster. </p>
<h1>Hip Labral Tear</h1>
<h2> What is a Hip Labral Tear? </h2>
<p> A hip labral tear is an injury to the labrum, the cartilage that surrounds the outside rim of your hip joint socket. </p>
<h2> Anatomy of the Hip Joint </h2>
<p> The hip joint is a ball and socket joint in which the head of the femur is the ball and the pelvic acetabulum forms the socket. The labrum helps to deepen the socket and provide stability to the joint. It also acts as a cushion and enables smooth movements of the joint. </p>
<h2> Causes of Hip Labral Tears </h2>
<p> A tear in the labrum of the hip can result from: </p>
<ul>
    <li> traumatic injury, such as a motor vehicle accident or from participating in sports such as football, soccer, basketball and snow skiing </li>
    <li> repetitive movements </li>
    <li> weight-bearing activities over time can lead to joint wear and tear </li>
    <li> degenerative changes to the hip joint in older patients </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of Hip Labral Tears </h2>
<p> Many patients with a hip labral tear do not have symptoms. However, some patients may experience: </p>
<ul>
    <li> pain in the hip or groin area </li>
    <li> a catching or locking sensation in the hip joint </li>
    <li> significant restriction in hip movement </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis of a Hip Labral Tear </h2>
<p> Your doctor will order certain tests to determine the cause of your hip pain. </p>
<p> X-rays of the hip allow your physician to rule out other possible conditions such as fractures or structural abnormalities. </p>
<p> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to evaluate the labrum. An injection of contrast material into the hip joint space at the time of the MRI can help show the labral tears much more clearly. </p>
<p> Injection of local anesthetic into the joint space is sometimes performed to confirm the location of the pain. If the injection completely relieves your pain, it is likely that the cause of the problem is located inside the hip joint. </p>
<h2> Treatment Options for a Hip Labral Tear </h2>
<p> Treatment for a hip labral tear will vary depending on the severity of the condition. People with a minor labral tear recover within a few weeks with the help of non-surgical treatments. </p>
<p> Conservative treatments include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Medications:</strong> Anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful in relieving pain and reducing inflammation associated with labral tears. Your doctor may also recommend cortisone injections to alleviate the pain associated with a hip labral tear. </li>
    <li> <strong>Physical therapy</strong> : Physical therapy that helps to improve hip range of motion, strength and stability are also recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p> However, severe cases may require arthroscopic surgery to remove or repair the torn portion of the labrum. </p>
<h2> Surgery for Hip Labral Tears </h2>
<p> Hip arthroscopy, also referred to as keyhole surgery or minimally invasive surgery, is a surgical procedure in which an arthroscope, a narrow tube with a tiny camera on the end, is used to assess and repair damage to the hip. </p>
<p> The surgery is performed with the patient under general, spinal or local anesthesia. </p>
<p> Your surgeon will make 2 or3 small incisions around the hip joint area. The arthroscope is inserted into the hip joint through one of the incisions to view the labral tear. The camera attached to the arthroscope displays the image of the joint on the monitor. A sterile solution will be pumped into the joint to have a clear view and room to work. Through the other incisions, specially designed instruments are inserted. Your surgeon repairs the torn tissue by sewing it back together or removes the torn piece all together, depending upon the cause and extent of the tear. After the completion of the procedure, the arthroscope and instruments are removed and the incisions are closed. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care following Surgery for Hip Labral Tears </h2>
<p> Following the surgery, you will be given instructions on caring for your incisions, activities to avoid and exercises to perform for a fast recovery and a successful outcome. Physical therapy will be recommended by your doctor to restore your strength and mobility. Your doctor will also prescribe pain medications to keep you comfortable. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Surgery for Hip Labral Tears </h2>
<p> Possible risks and complications specific to arthroscopic hip surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) </li>
    <li> Blood vessel or nerve damage </li>
    <li> Hemarthrosis (bleeding inside the joint) </li>
    <li> Failure to relieve pain </li>
</ul>

<h1>Chondral Lesions or Injuries</h1>
<h2> Hip Anatomy </h2>
<p> The hip joint is one of the largest weight-bearing joints in the body, formed by the thighbone or femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis. It is a ball and socket joint with the head of the femur as the ball and the pelvic acetabulum forming the socket. The joint surface is covered by a smooth articular cartilage which acts as a cushion and enables smooth movements of the joint. </p>
<h2> What are Chondral Lesions or Injuries? </h2>
<p> A chondral injury refers to an injury of the articular cartilage covering the joint. </p>
<h2> Causes of Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> Chondral injuries can result from various hip conditions such as labral tears, loose bodies, posterior dislocation, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), dysplasia, osteonecrosis, and degenerative arthritis. </p>
<p> Articular cartilage covering the hip joint can also be damaged by a direct blow to the outer part of the thigh. Femoroacetabular impingement or FAI can also cause chondral injuries. This is a condition characterized by excessive friction in the hip joint causing pain and decreased range of motion. The femoral head and acetabulum rub against each other eventually causing damage to the cartilage. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> Most patients with chondral injuries experience: </p>
<ul>
    <li> severe pain in the hip or groin </li>
    <li> a locking sensation in the hip joint </li>
    <li> significant restriction in hip movement </li>
</ul>
<p> In some patients, physical examination may also reveal a noticeable limp. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> Diagnosis of chondral injuries involves a thorough medical history and a physical examination by your doctor. In addition to this, X-rays and MRI scans are also useful in diagnosing these types of injuries. However, arthroscopy is the most accurate way of diagnosing, evaluating and managing chondral injuries. </p>
<h2> Treatments for Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> The management of chondral injuries depends on the severity of the injury and includes non-surgical and surgical modalities of treatment. Non-surgical treatment includes a healthy diet, regular exercise and avoidance of aggravating activities. </p>
<h2> Arthroscopic Surgery to Treat Chondral Lesions and Injuries </h2>
<p> Arthroscopic surgery is performed to treat chondral injuries when non-surgical options are ineffective and pain persists. </p>
<p> Hip arthroscopy, also referred to as keyhole surgery or minimally invasive surgery, is a surgical procedure employing an arthroscope, a narrow tube with a tiny camera attached on the end, to assess the damage to the hip. Your surgeon makes 2 to 3 small incisions around the hip joint. The arthroscope is inserted through one of the incisions and the camera attached to the arthroscope helps visualize the joint, on a monitor. A sterile solution is pumped into the joint to clear the view and increase the space for surgery. Specially designed instruments are inserted through the other incisions. During the surgery, any loose fragments, small pieces of bone and cartilage floating within the joint are removed. After the completion of the procedure, the arthroscope is removed and incisions are closed. </p>
<p> Other arthroscopic surgeries that may be recommended to manage chondral injuries include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Microfracture surgery:</strong> This technique to treat chondral injuries involves stimulating the formation of new articular cartilage by drilling numerous tiny holes in the bone underneath the damaged cartilage. This results in the formation of blood clots within the damaged cartilage, which stimulates the growth of new cartilage known as fibrocartilage. Although, the fibrocartilage formed is different from the normal hyaline cartilage, it can provide significant improvement in the symptoms. </li>
    <li> <strong>Autologous cartilage implantation (ACI):</strong> In this procedure, the cartilage, harvested from the patient or a cadaver, is cultured and later implanted over the damaged area of the joint. </li>
    <li> <strong>Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI):</strong> This technique employs cultured chondrocytes (the cells which produce the cartilage) to repair the articular cartilage damage. These chondrocytes are inserted onto a layer of collagen which is then implanted over the damaged area of the joint. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative Care following Surgery to Treat Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> Following the surgery, your doctor will instruct you on the care of your incision, activities to be avoided and exercise programs to hasten recovery. Physical therapy will be recommended to restore strength and mobility to the hip joint. You may also be prescribed medications to relieve pain. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Surgery to Treat Chondral Lesions or Injuries </h2>
<p> The possible risks and complications specific to arthroscopic hip surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) </li>
    <li> Blood vessel or nerve damage </li>
    <li> Hemarthrosis (bleeding inside the joint) </li>
    <li> Failure to relieve pain </li>

<h1>Knee</h1>
<h1>Knee Anatomy</h1>
<p> The knee is a complex joint made up of different structures including bones, tendons, ligaments and muscles. They all work together to maintain normal function and provide stability to the knee during movement. </p>
<p> Having a well-functioning healthy knee is essential for our mobility and ability to participate in various activities. Understanding the anatomy of the knee enhances your ability to discuss and choose the right treatment procedure for knee problems with your doctor. </p>
<h2> Bones of the Knee </h2>
<p> The knee is a hinge joint made up of two bones, the thighbone (femur) and the shinbone (tibia). There are two round knobs at the end of the femur called femoral condyles which articulate with the flat surface of the tibia called the tibial plateau. The tibia plateau on the inside of the leg is called the medial tibial plateau, and on the outside of the leg it is called the lateral tibial plateau. </p>
<p> The two femoral condyles form a groove on the front (anterior) side of the knee called the patellofemoral groove. A small bone called the patella sits in this groove and forms the kneecap. It acts as a shield and protects the knee joint from direct trauma. </p>
<p> A fourth bone called the fibula is the other bone of the lower leg. This forms a small joint with the tibia. This joint has very little movement and is not considered a part of the main joint of the knee. </p>
<h2> Articular Cartilage and Menisci of the Knee </h2>
<p> Movement of the bones causes friction between the articulating surfaces. To reduce this friction, all articulating surfaces involved in movement are covered with a white, shiny, slippery layer called articular cartilage. The articulating surface of the femoral condyles, tibial plateaus and the back of the patella are covered with this cartilage. The cartilage provides a smooth surface that facilitates easy movement. </p>
<p> To further reduce friction between the articulating surfaces of the bones, the knee joint is lined by a synovial membrane which produces a thick clear fluid called synovial fluid. This fluid lubricates and nourishes the cartilage and bones inside the joint capsule. </p>
<p> Within the knee joint, between the femur and tibia, there are two C shaped cartilaginous structures called menisci. Menisci function to provide stability to the knee by spreading the weight of the upper body across the whole surface of the tibial plateau. The menisci help in load- bearing by preventing the weight from concentrating onto a small area, which could damage the articular cartilage. The menisci also act as a cushion between the femur and tibia by absorbing the shock produced by activities such as walking, running and jumping. </p>
<h2> Ligaments of the Knee </h2>
<p> Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect one bone to another bone. The ligaments of the knee function to stabilize the knee joint. There are two important groups of ligaments that hold the bones of the knee joint together, collateral ligaments and the cruciate ligament. </p>
<p> Collateral ligaments are present on either side of the knee. They function to prevent the knee from moving too far during side to side motion. The collateral ligament on the inside is called the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the collateral ligament on the outside is called the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). </p>
<p> Cruciate ligaments, present inside the knee joint, control the back-and-forth motion of the knee. The cruciate ligament in the front of the knee is called anterior cruciate ligament or ACL and the cruciate ligament in the back of the knee is called posterior cruciate ligament or PCL. </p>
<h2> Muscles of the Knee </h2>
<p> Muscles: There are two major muscles, the quadriceps and the hamstrings, which enable movement of the knee joint. The quadriceps muscles are in the front of the thigh. When the quadriceps muscles contract, the knee straightens. The hamstrings are in the back of the thigh. When the hamstring muscles contract, the knee bends. </p>
<h2> Tendons of the Knee </h2>
<p> Tendons are structures that attach muscles to the bone. The quadriceps muscles of the knee meet just above the patella and attach to it through a tendon called the quadriceps tendon. The patella further attaches to the tibia through a tendon called the patella tendon. The quadriceps muscle, quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon all work together to straighten the knee. Similarly, the hamstring muscles at the back of the leg are attached to the knee joint with the hamstring tendon. </p>

<h1>Knee Pain</h1>
<h2> Anatomy of the Knee Joint </h2>
<p> The knee is one of the largest joints in the body, formed by the lower end of the femur, upper end of the tibia and the patella or kneecap. Several ligaments and muscles attach to the bones of the knee joint to maintain normal motion of the joint. Special cartilaginous tissues known as menisci are placed between the two articular ends of the joint. These act as a cushion between the articular surfaces and absorb the shock during movement. </p>
<h2> What is Knee Pain? </h2>
<p> Knee pain is a common condition affecting individuals from different age groups. It not only affects movement but also impacts the quality of life of the individual. An injury or disease of the knee joint or any structure surrounding the knee can result in knee pain. A precise diagnosis of the underlying cause is important to develop an appropriate treatment plan. </p>
<h2> Causes of Knee Pain </h2>
<p> Some of the common causes for knee pain include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Arthritis: a condition associated with inflammation of the joint </li>
    <li> Knee ligament injuries </li>
    <li> Torn meniscus </li>
    <li> Patellar tendonitis: inflammation of the patellar tendon which connects the kneecap to the shinbone </li>
    <li> Chondromalacia patellae: softening of the articular cartilage on the under surface of the kneecap causing knee pain </li>
    <li> Dislocated kneecap </li>
    <li> Baker's cyst: a fluid-filled swelling in the back of the knee which usually results from another problem such as a meniscus tear </li>
    <li> Knee bursitis: inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs located around the joints, usually between a tendon and the bone. </li>
    <li> Plica syndrome: results from inflammation of the synovial tissue of the knee causing knee pain and swelling. </li>
    <li> Osgood-Schlatter disease: caused by irritation of the growth plate at the front of the knee joint and is more common in adolescents </li>
    <li> Osteochondritis dissecans: characterized by detachment of a cartilage fragment and a thin layer of the bone from the end of a bone due to inadequate blood supply; these fragments may either stay in place or slide around the joint causing pain and joint instability </li>
    <li> Gout: characterized by sudden, severe attacks of joint pain, with swelling and redness around the joint, caused by accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints </li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagnosis of Knee Pain</h2>
<p> Knee conditions should be evaluated by your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. A detailed medical history and physical examination of the knee are crucial for the diagnosis. Your doctor may also conduct diagnostic imaging studies such as X-rays, MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasound. Blood tests may be performed to identify any infection, gout or pseudogout. Sometimes, arthrocentesis may also be performed, wherein the fluid from the knee joint is removed and sent for laboratory analysis. </p>
<h2> Treatment of Knee Pain </h2>
<p> Treatment options depend upon the underlying cause responsible for knee pain. Some of the common treatment options for knee pain include rest, ice and heat application, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, stretching, physical therapy and cortisone injections. </p>
<p> Sometimes, a knee arthroscopy may be performed. Knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure in which the internal structures of the joint are examined to diagnose as well as treat the underlying problem. </p>
<p> If you have trouble or inability to walk, deformity around the joint, inability to bend the knee, knee pain persisting beyond a few days and more at night, or pain associated with swelling, warmth, or redness, you should consult your doctor for immediate medical intervention. </p>
<h1>Knee Arthritis</h1>
<h2> What is Knee Arthritis? </h2>
<p> Arthritis is a general term covering numerous conditions where the joint surface or cartilage wears out. The joint surface is covered by a smooth articular surface that allows pain-free movement in the joint. This surface can wear out for several reasons; often the definite cause is not known. Arthritis often affects the knee joint. </p>
<p> When the articular cartilage wears out, the bone ends rub on one another and cause pain. This condition is referred to as Osteoarthritis or "wear and tear" arthritis, as it occurs with aging and use. It is the most common type of arthritis. </p>
<h2> Causes of Knee Arthritis </h2>
<p> There are numerous conditions that can cause arthritis but often the exact cause is never known. In general, but not always, it affects people as they get older (Osteoarthritis). </p>
<p> The causes include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Trauma (fracture) </li>
    <li> Increased stress such as overuse and overweight </li>
    <li> Infection of the bone </li>
    <li> Connective tissue disorders </li>
    <li> Inactive lifestyle and obesity (overweight). Your weight is the single most important link between diet and arthritis, as being overweight puts an additional burden on your hips, knees, ankles and feet. </li>
    <li> Inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis) </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of Knee Arthritis </h2>
<p> Knee arthritis causes pain and decreased mobility of the knee joint. In the arthritic knee, there is an absent joint space that shows on X-ray. In the normal knee, there is a normal joint space. </p>
<p> The cartilage lining is thinner than normal or completely absent. The degree of cartilage damage and inflammation varies with the type and stage of arthritis. The capsule of the arthritic knee is swollen. The joint space is narrowed and irregular in outline; this can be seen in an X-ray image. Bone spurs or excessive bone can also build up around the edges of the joint. The combinations of these factors make the arthritic knee stiff and limit activities due to pain or fatigue. </p>
<h1>ACL Tears</h1>
<h2> What is the ACL? </h2>
<p> The anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, is one of the major ligaments of the knee that is in the middle of the knee and runs from the femur (thighbone) to the tibia (shinbone). It prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur. Together with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) it provides rotational stability to the knee. </p>
<h2> Causes of ACL Tears </h2>
<p> An ACL injury is a sports-related injury that occurs when the knee is forcefully twisted or hyperextended. An ACL tear usually occurs with an abrupt directional change with the foot fixed on the ground or when the deceleration force crosses the knee. Changing direction rapidly, stopping suddenly, slowing down while running, landing from a jump incorrectly, and direct contact or collision, such as a football tackle can also cause injury to the ACL. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of ACL Tears </h2>
<p> When you injure your ACL, you might hear a "popping" sound and you may feel as though the knee has given way. Within the first two hours after injury, your knee will swell and you may have a buckling sensation in the knee during twisting movements. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of ACL Tears </h2>
<p> Diagnosis of an ACL tear is made by knowing your symptoms, medical history, performing a physical examination of the knee, and performing other diagnostic tests such as X-rays, MRI scans, stress tests of the ligament and arthroscopy. </p>
<h2> Treatment of ACL Tears </h2>
<p> Treatment options include both non-surgical and surgical methods. If the overall stability of the knee is intact, your doctor may recommend non-surgical methods. Non-surgical treatment consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol); all assist in controlling pain and swelling. Physical therapy may be recommended to improve knee motion and strength. A knee brace may be needed to help immobilize your knee. </p>
<p> Young athletes involved in pivoting sports will most likely require surgery to safely return to sports. The usual surgery for an ACL tear is an ACL reconstruction which tightens your knee and restores its stability. Surgery to reconstruct an ACL is done with an arthroscope using small incisions. Your doctor will replace the torn ligament with a tissue graft that can be obtained from your knee (patellar tendon) or hamstring muscle. Following ACL reconstruction, a rehabilitation program is started to help you to resume a wider range of activities. </p>
<h1>PCL Tears</h1>
<p> Coming Soon </p>
<h1>MCL Tears</h1>
<h2> What is the Medial Collateral Ligament? </h2>
<p> The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is the ligament that is located on the inner part of the knee joint. It runs from the femur (thighbone) to the top of the tibia (shinbone) and helps in stabilizing the knee. </p>
<h2> Causes of Medial Collateral Ligament Tears </h2>
<p> Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury can result in a stretch, partial tear, or complete tear of the ligament. Injuries to the MCL commonly occur because of pressure or stress on the outside part of the knee. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) may be torn along with an MCL injury. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Medial Collateral Ligament Tears </h2>
<p> Patients with an MCL tear have symptoms such as knee pain, swelling, and locking or catching sensation in the knee during movement. Patients may also feel as though their knee may 'give way' suddenly or buckle. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Medial Collateral Ligament Tears </h2>
<p> Your doctor will usually diagnose an MCL injury based on a physical examination of your knee. To determine looseness of the ligament, an MCL test may be performed by exerting pressure on the outside of your knee while your knee is bent to 25 degrees. In addition, other tests such as knee joint X-rays and MRI scan may be done. </p>
<h2> Treatment of Medial Collateral Ligament Tears </h2>
<p> Treatment options include non-surgical and surgical treatment. Non-surgical treatment consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol); all assist in controlling pain and swelling. A knee brace may be worn to help immobilize your knee. Use of crutches may be recommended to protect your knee and to keep you from putting weight on your knee while walking. Physical therapy exercises may be recommended to improve knee motion and strength. </p>
<p> Most often, surgery is not necessary for the treatment of an MCL tear. If needed, it is usually performed using arthroscopy. In many cases, this injury cannot be prevented. However, using proper techniques during sports or exercising can help prevent injury. </p>
<h2> Medial Collateral Ligament Tear in Children </h2>
<p> The skeletally immature knee in a child slightly differs from the adult knee and may result in mild variations of injury patterns. In children, the epiphyseal plates (growth plates) are weak compared with ligaments in the adults. Growth plate, also called the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue made up of cartilage (rubbery material) found at the ends of the long bones in children. Therefore, any extraneous force on the knee causes physeal injury rather than the ligament injury. Hence MCL injuries are less common in children. </p>
<p> Most often, it occurs in teenage athletes who participate in sports, such as football and ice hockey. Younger children below the age of 12 years are less likely to injure their MCL, as the bone where the ligament attaches may break. </p>
<h1>Meniscal Tears</h1>
<h2> What is a Meniscal Tear? </h2>
<p> Meniscus tear is the commonest knee injury in athletes, especially those involved in contact sports. A sudden bend or twist in your knee causes the meniscus to tear. This is a traumatic meniscus tear. Elderly people are more prone to degenerative meniscal tears as the cartilage wears out and weakens with age. The two wedge-shaped cartilage pieces present between the thighbone and the shinbone are called meniscus. They stabilize the knee joint and act as "shock absorbers". </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Meniscal Tears </h2>
<p> Torn meniscus causes pain, swelling, stiffness, catching or locking sensation in your knee making you unable to move your knee through its complete range of motion. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Meniscal Tears </h2>
<p> Your orthopedic surgeon will examine your knee, evaluate your symptoms and medical history before suggesting a treatment plan. The treatment depends on the type, size and location of tear as well your age and activity level. If the tear is small with damage only in the outer edge of the meniscus, non-surgical treatment may be sufficient. However, if the symptoms do not resolve with non-surgical treatment, surgical treatment may be recommended. </p>
<h2> Surgical Treatment for Meniscal Tears </h2>
<p> Knee arthroscopy is the commonly recommended surgical procedure for meniscal tears. The surgical treatment options include meniscus removal (meniscectomy), meniscus repair, and meniscus replacement. Surgery can be performed using arthroscopy where a tiny camera will be inserted through a tiny incision which enables the surgeon to view the inside of your knee on a large screen and through other tiny incisions, surgery will be performed. During meniscectomy, small instruments called shavers or scissors may be used to remove the torn meniscus. In arthroscopic meniscus repair the torn meniscus will be pinned or sutured depending on the extent of tear. </p>
<p> Meniscus replacement or transplantation involves replacement of a torn cartilage with the cartilage obtained from a donor or a cultured patch obtained from a laboratory. It is considered as a treatment option to relieve knee pain in patients who have undergone meniscectomy. </p>

<h1>Chondral (Articular Cartilage Defects)</h1>
<h2>What is an Articular Cartilage Defect?</h2>
<p> Articular or hyaline cartilage is the tissue lining the surface of the two bones in the knee joint. Cartilage helps the bones move smoothly against each other and can withstand the weight of the body during activities such as running and jumping. Articular cartilage does not have a direct blood supply to it, so has less capacity to repair itself. Once the cartilage is torn it will not heal easily and can lead to degeneration of the articular surface , leading to development of osteoarthritis. </p>
<h2> Causes of Articular Cartilage Defects </h2>
<p> The damage in articular cartilage can affect people of all ages. It can be damaged by trauma such as accidents, mechanical injury such as a fall, or from degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis) occurring in older people. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Articular Cartilage Defects </h2>
<p> Patients with articular cartilage damage experience symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and a decrease in range of motion of the knee. Damaged cartilage needs to be replaced with healthy cartilage and the procedure is known as cartilage replacement. It is a surgical procedure performed to replace the worn-out cartilage and is usually performed to treat patients with small areas of cartilage damage usually caused by sports or traumatic injuries. It is not indicated for those patients who have advanced arthritis of the knee. </p>
<h2> Treatment of Articular Cartilage Defects </h2>
<p> Cartilage replacement helps relieve pain, restore normal function, and can delay or prevent the onset of arthritis. The goal of cartilage replacement procedures is to stimulate growth of new hyaline cartilage. Various arthroscopic procedures involved in cartilage replacement include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Microfracture </li>
    <li> Drilling </li>
    <li> Abrasion Arthroplasty </li>
    <li> Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) </li>
    <li> Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation </li>
</ul>
<h1>Ankle</h1>
<h1>Ankle Sprain</h1>
<h2> What is an Ankle Sprain? </h2>
<p> A sprain is the stretching or tearing of ligaments, which connect adjacent bones and provide stability to a joint. An ankle sprain is a common injury that occurs when you suddenly fall or twist the ankle joint or when you land your foot in an awkward position after a jump. Most commonly it occurs when you participate in sports or when you jump or run on a surface that is irregular. </p>
<h2> What are the Symptoms of an Ankle Sprain? </h2>
<p> Ankle sprains can cause pain, swelling, tenderness, bruising, stiffness and inability to walk or bear weight on the ankle. </p>
<h2> How are Ankle Sprains Diagnosed? </h2>
<p> The diagnosis of an ankle sprain is usually made by evaluating the history of the injury and physical examination of the ankle. X-ray of your ankle may be needed to confirm if a fracture is present. </p>
<h2> What are the Treatment Options for Ankle Sprains? </h2>
<p> The most common treatment recommended for ankle sprains is rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE). </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Rest:</strong> You should not move or use the injured part in order to reduce pain and prevent further damage. Crutches may be ordered to limit weight-bearing while walking. </li>
    <li> <strong>Ice:</strong> An ice-pack should be applied over the injured area up to 3 days after the injury. You can use a cold pack or crushed ice wrapped in a towel. Never place ice directly over the skin. Ice packs help to reduce swelling and to relieve pain. </li>
    <li> <strong>Compression:</strong> Compression of the injured area helps to reduce swelling and bruising. This is usually accomplished by using an elastic wrap for a few days or weeks after the injury. </li>
    <li> <strong>Elevation:</strong> Place the injured ankle above your heart level to reduce swelling. Elevation of an injured leg can be done for about 2 to 3 hours a day. </li>
</ul>
<p> The doctor may also use a brace or splint to reduce motion of the ankle. Anti-inflammatory pain medications may be prescribed to help reduce the pain and control inflammation. </p>
<h2> What is the Rehabilitation for an Ankle Sprain? </h2>
<p> During your recovery, rehabilitation exercises are recommended to strengthen and improve range of motion in your foot. You may need to use a brace or wrap to support and protect your ankle during sports activities. Avoid pivoting and twisting movements for 2 to 3 weeks. To prevent further sprains or recurrence of injury, you may need to wear a semi-rigid ankle brace during exercise, special wraps and high-top lace shoes. </p>
<p> <strong>Ankle Sprain</strong> <a href="http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/foot-ankle/ankle-sprain-t103/video/">http://www.ypo.education/orthopaedics/foot-ankle/ankle-sprain-t103/video/</a> </p>
<h1>Ankle Fractures</h1>
<h2> What is Normal Ankle Joint Anatomy? </h2>
<p> The ankle joint is composed of three bones: the tibia, fibula and talus, which are articulated together. The ends of the fibula and tibia (lower leg bones) form the inner and outer malleolus, which are the bony protrusions of the ankle joint that you can feel and see on either side of the ankle. The joint is protected by a fibrous membrane called a joint capsule, and filled with synovial fluid to enable smooth movement. </p>
<h2> What is an Ankle Fracture? </h2>
<p> Ankle injuries are very common in athletes and in people performing physical work, often resulting in severe pain and impaired mobility. Pain after ankle injuries can either be from a torn ligament and is called an ankle sprain or from a broken bone which is called an ankle fracture. An ankle fracture is a painful condition where there is a break in one or more bones forming the ankle joint. The ankle joint is stabilized by different ligaments and other soft tissues, which may also be injured during an ankle fracture. </p>
<h2> What are the Common Causes of Ankle Fractures? </h2>
<p> Ankle fractures occur from excessive rolling and twisting of the ankle, usually occurring from an accident or activities such as jumping or falling causing sudden stress to the joint. </p>
<h2> What are the Symptoms of an Ankle Fracture? </h2>
<p> With an ankle fracture, there is immediate swelling and pain around the ankle as well as impaired mobility. In some cases, blood may accumulate around the joint, a condition called hemarthrosis. In cases of severe fracture, deformity around the ankle joint is clearly visible where bone may protrude through the skin. </p>
<h2> What are the Types of Ankle Fractures? </h2>
<p> Ankle fractures are classified according to their location. The different types of ankle fractures are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Lateral Malleolus fracture in which the lateral malleolus, the outer part of the ankle, is fractured. </li>
    <li> Medial Malleolus fracture in which the medial malleolus, the inner part of the ankle, is fractured. </li>
    <li> Posterior Malleolus fracture in which the posterior malleolus, the bony hump of the tibia, is fractured. </li>
    <li> Bimalleolar fractures in which both lateral and medial malleolus bones are fractured. </li>
    <li> Trimalleolar fractures in which all three lateral, medial, and posterior bones are fractured. </li>
    <li> Syndesmotic injury, also called a high ankle sprain, is usually not a fracture, but can be treated as a fracture. </li>
</ul>
<h2> How is an Ankle Fracture Diagnosed? </h2>
<p> The diagnosis of the ankle injury starts with a physical examination, followed by X-rays and CT scan of the injured area for a detailed view. Usually it is very difficult to differentiate a broken ankle from other conditions such as a sprain, dislocation, or tendon injury without having an X-ray of the injured ankle. In some cases, pressure is applied on the ankle and then special X-rays are taken. This procedure is called a stress test. This test is employed to check the stability of the fracture to decide if surgery is necessary or not. In complex cases where detailed evaluation of the ligaments is required an MRI scan is recommended. </p>
<h2> What are the Treatment Options for Ankle Fractures? </h2>
<p> Immediately following an ankle injury and prior to seeing a doctor, you should apply ice packs and keep the foot elevated to minimize pain and swelling. </p>
<p> The treatment of an ankle fracture depends upon the type and the stability of the fractured bone. Treatment starts with non-surgical methods, and in cases where the fracture is unstable and cannot be realigned, surgical methods are employed. </p>
<p> In non-surgical treatment, the ankle bone is realigned and special splints or a plaster cast is placed around the joint, for at least 2-3 weeks. </p>
<p> With surgical treatment, the fractured bone is accessed by making an incision over the ankle area and then specially designed plates are screwed onto the bone to realign and stabilize the fractured parts. The incision is then sutured closed and the operated ankle is immobilized with a splint or cast. </p>
<h2> What is the Postoperative Care for an Ankle Fracture? </h2>
<p> After ankle surgery, you will be instructed to avoid putting weight on the ankle by using crutches while walking for at least six weeks. </p>
<p> Physical therapy of the ankle joint will be recommended by the doctor. After 2-3 months of therapy, the patient may be able to perform normal daily activities. </p>
<h2> What are the Risks and Complications of an Ankle Fracture? </h2>
<p> Risks and complications that can occur with ankle fractures include improper casting or improper alignment of the bones which can cause deformities and eventually arthritis. In some cases, pressure exerted on the nerves can cause nerve damage, resulting in severe pain. </p>
<p> Rarely, surgery may result in incomplete healing of the fracture, which requires another surgery to repair. </p>

<h1>Procedures</h1>
<h1>Shoulder</h1>
<h1>Shoulder Arthroscopy</h1>
<h2> What is Shoulder Arthroscopy? </h2>
<p> Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive diagnostic and surgical procedure performed for joint problems. Shoulder arthroscopy is performed using a pencil-sized instrument called an arthroscope. The arthroscope consists of a light system and camera to project images onto a computer screen for your surgeon to view the surgical site. Arthroscopy is used to treat disease conditions and injuries involving the bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and muscles of the shoulder joint. </p>
<h2> Shoulder Anatomy </h2>
<p> The shoulder joint is made up of a ball and socket joint, where the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) articulates with the socket of the scapula (shoulder blade) called the glenoid. The two articulating surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, which prevents friction between the moving bones enabling smooth movement. Tendons and ligaments around the shoulder joint provide strength and stability to the joint. </p>
<h2> Disease Overview </h2>
<p> Injury and disease to the bones or soft tissues of the shoulder joint can make it unstable, and lead to pain, inflammation and reduced mobility. </p>
<h2> Indications of Shoulder Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> Shoulder arthroscopy is indicated to treat the following Shoulder when conservative treatment such as medication and therapy fails to relieve pain and disability: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Shoulder Impingement: this occurs when the shoulder blade applies pressure on the underlying soft tissues when the arm is lifted </li>
    <li> Rotator cuff tear </li>
    <li> Frozen shoulder or stiffness of the shoulder joint </li>
    <li> Shoulder Instability: this occurs when the head of the upper arm bone slips out of the socket of the shoulder blade's glenoid cavity either due to injury or overuse </li>
    <li> Biceps rupture occurs when the tendons attaching the bicep muscle to the shoulder or elbow tears </li>
    <li> Damaged cartilage or ligaments </li>
    <li> Bone spurs or bony projections </li>
    <li> Arthritis of the collarbone </li>
</ul>
<h2> Shoulder Arthroscopy Procedure </h2>
<p> Your surgeon performs shoulder arthroscopy under general or regional anesthesia. You may be positioned lying down on your side with your arm propped up or sitting in a semi-seated position. Sterile fluid is injected into the shoulder joint to expand the surgical area so your surgeon has a clear view of the damage and room to work. A button-sized hole is made in the shoulder and the arthroscope is inserted. Your surgeon can view images captured by the camera in the arthroscope on a large monitor. Surgical instruments are introduced into the joint through separate small holes to remove and repair the damage to the joint. After surgery, the instruments are removed and the incisions are closed with stitches or small sterile bandage strips. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Shoulder Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> After the surgery, the small surgical wounds take a few days to heal and the surgical dressing is replaced by simple band-aids. The recovery time depends on the type and extent of problem for which the procedure was performed. Pain medications are prescribed to keep you comfortable. The arm of the affected shoulder is placed in a sling for a short period as recommended by your doctor. Physical therapy is advised to improve shoulder mobility and strength after the surgery. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Shoulder Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> The advantages of arthroscopy compared to open surgery with a large incision include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Less pain </li>
    <li> Fewer complications </li>
    <li> Shorter hospital stay </li>
    <li> Faster recovery </li>
</ul>
<h2> Risks and complications of Shoulder Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> Complications of shoulder arthroscopy include infection, bleeding, damage to nearby nerves or blood vessels, or delayed healing after the surgery. In certain cases, stiffness of the shoulder joint may occur after the surgery. It is important to participate actively in your physical therapy to prevent this from occurring. </p>

<h1>Rotator Cuff Repair</h1>
<p> Coming Soon </p>
<h1>Shoulder Stabilization</h1>
<h2> Disease Overview </h2>
<p> Shoulder instability is a chronic condition that causes frequent dislocations of the shoulder joint. A dislocation occurs when the end of the humerus (the ball portion) partially or completely dislocates from the glenoid (the socket portion) of the shoulder. A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation whereas a complete separation is referred to as a dislocation. The repeated dislocation of the humerus out of its socket is called chronic shoulder instability. A tear in the labrum or rotator cuff and ligament tear in the front of the shoulder (a Bankart lesion) may lead to repeated shoulder dislocations. </p>
<h2>Indications for Shoulder Stabilization</h2> 
<p>When conservative treatment options such as medications, rest, and ice application fail to relieve shoulder instability, your surgeon may recommend shoulder stabilization surgery. </p>
<h2> Shoulder Stabilization Procedure </h2>
<p> Shoulder stabilization surgery is done to improve stability and function to the shoulder joint and prevent recurrent dislocations. It can be performed arthroscopically, depending on your particular condition, with much smaller incisions. Arthroscopic stabilization is a surgical procedure to treat chronic instability of the shoulder joint.  </p>
<p> Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgery and is performed through two tiny incisions (portals), about half-inch in length made around the joint area. Through one of the incisions, an arthroscope (small fiber-optic viewing instrument) is passed. A television camera attached to the arthroscope displays the images of the inside of the joint on the television monitor, which allows your surgeon to look at the cartilage, ligaments and the rotator cuff while performing the procedure. A sterile saline solution is pumped into the joint which expands it and gives a clearer view to the surgeon. Bone spurs, defects or tissue tears will be identified. </p>
<p> Your surgeon makes use of tiny surgical instruments which are passed through the other incisions to treat the condition. Any tear in the rotator cuff will be sutured or stapled. The sutures will be held in place with help of a small anchor which is drilled into the upper part of the humerus. Further, a thermal shrinkage device may be used in order to make the ligaments tight and prevent instability. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Shoulder Stabilisation </h2>
<p> Following the procedure, your surgeon may advise the use of a continuous passive motion machine to prevent stiffness and improve range of motion of the shoulder joint. Pain medications will be prescribed to keep you comfortable. A shoulder sling can be worn for 4-6 weeks to immobilize and facilitate healing. Postoperative rehabilitation program including strengthening exercises will be advised for 6-9 months. You will be able to participate in sports in about 18 to 36 weeks after the surgery. </p>
 <h2>Advantages of Shoulder Stabilization</h2> 
<p>The major benefits of arthroscopic stabilization as compared to open repair of instability are that it gives a chance to identify and treat coexisting diseases, lesser pain and complications, combined with shorter hospital stay. </p>
 <h2>Risks and Complications of Shoulder Stabilization</h2> 
<p>As with any surgical procedure, there may be certain risks and complications involved and include infection of the surgical wound, post-operative stiffness, risk of arthritis, muscle weakness and injury to the nerves and blood vessels. </p>

<h1>Shoulder Joint Replacement</h1>
<h2> Shoulder Anatomy </h2>
<p> The shoulder is a highly movable body joint that allows various movements of the arm. It is a ball and socket joint, where the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) articulates with the socket of the scapula (shoulder blade) called the glenoid. The two articulating surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, which prevents friction between the moving bones. The cartilage is lubricated by synovial fluid. Tendons and ligaments around the shoulder joint provide strength and stability to the joint. </p>
<h2> What is Osteoarthritis? </h2>
<p> When the cartilage is damaged, the two bones rub against each other resulting in pain, swelling and stiffness of the joint (osteoarthritis). </p>
<h2> What is Shoulder Joint Replacement? </h2>
<p> Total shoulder replacement surgery is performed to relieve these symptoms. In this surgery, the damaged articulating parts of the shoulder joint are removed and replaced with artificial prostheses. Replacement of both the humeral head and the socket is called a total shoulder replacement. </p>
<h2> What are the Indications for Shoulder Joint Replacement? </h2>
<p> Total shoulder joint replacement surgery is indicated for conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis when medication, injections, physical therapy, and activity changes do not help relieve pain. Your doctor recommends surgery when you have the following symptoms: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Severe shoulder pain that restricts daily activities </li>
    <li> Moderate to severe pain during rest </li>
    <li> Weakness and/or loss of motion </li>
</ul>
<h2> Preparation for Shoulder Joint Replacement </h2>
<p> To decide whether total shoulder replacement is a good option for you, your surgeon will evaluate your condition thoroughly. </p>
<p> Your surgeon reviews your medical history and performs a physical examination of your shoulder to assess the extent of mobility and pain. Imaging tests such as X-ray or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are ordered. </p>
<h2> Shoulder Joint Replacement Procedure </h2>
<p> The surgery is done under regional or general anesthesia. An incision is made over the affected shoulder and the underlying muscles are separated to expose the shoulder joint. The surgery may be performed as open surgery, where a large incision is made, or minimally invasive, where small incisions are made to insert an arthroscope (a thin tube with a camera and light source) and surgical tools. </p>
<p> The upper arm bone (humerus) is separated from the glenoid socket of the shoulder bone. The arthritic or damaged humeral head is cut and the humerus bone is hollowed out and filled with cement. A metal ball with a stem is gently press- fit into the humerus. </p>
<p> Next, the arthritic part of the socket is prepared. The plastic glenoid component is fixed in the shoulder bone. </p>
<p> After the artificial components are implanted, the joint capsule is stitched and the wound is closed. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Shoulder Joint Replacement </h2>
<p> After the surgery, pain medications and antibiotics are prescribed to control pain and prevent infection. Your arm may be secured in a sling or cast. The rehabilitation program includes physical therapy, which is started soon after the surgery and is very important to strengthen and provide mobility to the shoulder. You may be able to perform gentle daily activities two to six weeks after surgery. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Shoulder Joint Replacement </h2>
<p> As with any major surgery, there may be potential risks involved: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Anesthetic complications such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting </li>
    <li> Infection of the wound </li>
    <li> Dislocation, requiring repeat surgery </li>
    <li> Damage to blood vessels, nerves or muscles </li>
    <li> Failure to relieve pain </li>
    <li> Pulmonary embolism </li>
    <li> Wear and tear of prosthesis </li>
</ul>

<h1>Reverse Shoulder Replacement</h1>
<h2> What is Reverse Shoulder Replacement? </h2>
<p> Reverse total shoulder replacement, is an advanced surgical technique specifically designed for rotator cuff tear arthropathy, a condition where the patient suffers from both shoulder arthritis and a rotator cuff tear. </p>
<h2> Shoulder Anatomy </h2>
<p> The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint formed by the union of the head of the upper arm bone (humerus) and the shoulder socket (glenoid). The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons that join the head of the humerus to the deeper shoulder muscles to provide stability and mobility to the shoulder joint. </p>
<h2> Rotator Cuff Arthropathy </h2>
<p> When the rotator cuff is torn, it can cause wear and tear to the shoulder joint and lead to shoulder arthritis. Conventional surgical methods such as total shoulder joint replacement have been shown to be significantly ineffective in the treatment of rotator cuff arthropathy. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Arthropathy </h2>
<p> Patients with rotator cuff arthropathy may feel pain (usually at night) and weakness within the involved shoulder. Patients may have had a prior rotator cuff repair or a history of multiple repairs. The most common symptom is the inability to raise the arm above the shoulder to perform overhead activities. </p>
<h2> Differences between Conventional and Reverse Shoulder Replacement </h2>
<p> Conventional shoulder replacement surgery involves replacing the ball of the arm bone (humerus) with a metal ball and the socket (glenoid cavity) of the shoulder blade (scapula) with a plastic socket. If this surgery is used to treat rotator cuff arthropathy, it may result in loosening of the implants due to the torn rotator cuff. Therefore, a specifically designed surgery was developed called reverse total shoulder replacement to be employed in such cases. </p>
<p> In reverse total shoulder replacement, the placement of the artificial components is essentially reversed. In other words, the humeral ball is placed in the glenoid cavity of the shoulder blade (scapula) and the plastic socket is placed on top of the arm bone. This design makes efficient use of the deltoid muscle, the large shoulder muscle, to compensate for the torn rotator cuff. </p>
<h2> Ideal candidates for Reverse Shoulder Replacement </h2>
<p> Reverse total shoulder replacement may be recommended for the following conditions: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Completely torn rotator cuff that is difficult to repair </li>
    <li> Presence of cuff tear arthropathy </li>
    <li> Previous unsuccessful shoulder replacement </li>
    <li> Severe shoulder pain and difficulty in performing overhead activities </li>
    <li> Continued pain despite other treatments such as rest, medications, cortisone injections, and physical therapy </li>
</ul>
<h2> Reverse Shoulder Replacement Procedure </h2>
<p> Reverse total shoulder replacement surgery is performed with the patient under general anesthesia. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Your surgeon makes an incision over the affected shoulder to expose the shoulder joint. </li>
    <li> The humerus is separated from the glenoid socket of the scapula (shoulder blade). </li>
    <li> The arthritic parts of the humeral head and the socket are removed and prepared for insertion of the artificial components. </li>
    <li> The artificial components include the metal ball that is screwed into the shoulder socket and the plastic cup that is cemented into the upper arm bone. </li>
    <li> The artificial components are then fixed in place. </li>
    <li> The joint capsule is stitched together, the tissues approximated and the wound is closed with sutures. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative care for Reverse Shoulder Replacement </h2>
<p> Patients can get out of bed on the same day of the surgery, but usually stay in the hospital for 1-2 days. General post-operative instructions include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Take all prescribed medications as instructed </li>
    <li> Undergo gentle range of motion exercises to increase your shoulder mobility </li>
    <li> Physical therapy will be recommended to strengthen the shoulder and improve flexibility </li>
    <li> Avoid overhead activities for at least 6 weeks </li>
    <li> Don't push yourself up out of a chair or bed using your shoulder muscles </li>
    <li> Avoid lifting heavy objects </li>
</ul>
<h2> Risks and complications of Reverse Shoulder Replacement </h2>
<p> Possible risks and complications associated with reverse total shoulder replacement surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Dislocation or instability of the implanted joint </li>
    <li> Fracture of the humerus or scapula </li>
    <li> Damage to nerves or blood vessels </li>
    <li> Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) </li>
    <li> Wound irritation </li>
    <li> Arm length discrepancies </li>
    <li> Wearing out of the components </li>

<h1>Elbow</h1>
<h1>Elbow Arthroscopy</h1>
<h2> What is Elbow Arthroscopy? </h2>
<p> Elbow arthroscopy, also referred to as keyhole or minimally invasive surgery, is performed through tiny incisions to evaluate and treat several elbow conditions. </p>
<h2> Elbow Anatomy </h2>
<p> The elbow is a complex hinge joint formed by the articulation of three bones - humerus, radius and ulna. The upper arm bone or humerus connects the shoulder to the elbow forming the upper portion of the hinge joint. The lower arm consists of two bones, the radius and the ulna. These bones connect the wrist to the elbow forming the lower portion of the hinge joint. </p>
<p> The three joints of the elbow are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Ulnohumeral joint, the junction between the ulna and humerus </li>
    <li> Radiohumeral joint, the junction between the radius and humerus </li>
    <li> Proximal radioulnar joint, the junction between the radius and ulna </li>
</ul>
<p> The elbow is held in place with the support of various soft tissues including cartilage, tendons, ligaments, muscles, nerves, blood vessels and bursae. </p>

<p> Elbow arthroscopy is usually recommended for the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Debridement of loose bodies such as bone chips or torn cartilage tissue </li>
    <li> Removal of scar tissue </li>
    <li> Removal of bone spurs: These are extra bony growths caused by injury or arthritis that damage the ends of bones causing pain and limited mobility. </li>
</ul>
<p> Arthroscopy is also used for the: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and a condition called osteochondritis dissecans where loose fragments of cartilage and bone are in the joint space. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Evaluation and Diagnosis </h2>
<p> Your surgeon will review your medical history and perform a complete physical examination. Diagnostic studies may also be ordered such as X-rays, MRI or CT scan to assist in diagnosis. </p>
<h2> Elbow Arthroscopy Procedure </h2>
<p> Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure in which an arthroscope, a small soft flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end, is inserted into a joint to evaluate and treat a variety of conditions. </p>
<p> Elbow arthroscopy is commonly performed under general anesthesia as an outpatient procedure. The patient is placed in a lateral or prone position which allows the surgeon to easily adjust the arthroscope and have a clear view of the inside of the elbow. </p>
<p> Several tiny incisions are made to insert the arthroscope and small surgical instruments into the joint. To enhance the clarity of the elbow structures through the arthroscope, your surgeon will fill the elbow joint with a sterile liquid. </p>
<p> The liquid flows through the arthroscope to maintain clarity and to restrict any bleeding. The camera attached to the arthroscope displays the internal structures of the elbow on the monitor and helps your surgeon to evaluate the joint and direct the surgical instruments to fix the problem. </p>
<p> At the end of the procedure, the surgical incisions are closed by sutures, and a soft sterile dressing is applied. Your surgeon will place a cast or a splint to restrict the movement of the elbow. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Elbow Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> The advantages of arthroscopy compared to traditional open elbow surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Smaller incisions </li>
    <li> Minimal soft tissue trauma </li>
    <li> Less post-operative pain </li>
    <li> Faster healing time </li>
    <li> Lower infection rate </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative care for Elbow Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> The post-surgical instructions include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Make sure to get adequate rest. </li>
    <li> Raise your elbow on pillows above the level of the heart to help reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> Keep the incision area clean and dry. </li>
    <li> A compressive stocking may be applied from the armpit to the hand once the dressing is removed to decrease pain and increase range of motion. </li>
    <li> Your doctor will prescribe pain medications to keep you comfortable. </li>
    <li> Physical therapy will be ordered to restore normal elbow strength. </li>
    <li> Eating a healthy diet and not smoking will promote healing. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Complications of Elbow Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> The possible complications following elbow arthroscopy include infection, bleeding, and damage to nerves or blood vessels. </p>

<h1>Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery</h1>
<h2> What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? </h2>
<p> Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common, painful, progressive condition that is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist area. </p>
<p> Common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness and tingling sensation in all the fingers except the little finger; pain and burning sensation in hand and wrist that may radiate up the arm and elbow; and weakness in hand with diminished grip strength. </p>
<h2> Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> If conservative treatment options fail to resolve the condition your surgeon may recommend surgical procedure. </p>
<p> Carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. Traditional surgery involves up to a 2- inch incision in the palm and wrist area, whereas endoscopic surgery involves one or two half-an-inch incisions and the use of an endoscope. During the surgery, the transverse carpal ligament will be dissected to release the pressure on the median nerve and enlarge the carpal tunnel. Your surgeon will decide which options are best for you based on your general and medical conditions. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> Your surgeon may suggest you practice certain Postoperative procedures for better recovery and to avoid further complications. </p>
<ul>
    <li> Elevate the hand above heart level to reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> A splint may be worn </li>
    <li> Ice packs to the surgical area to reduce swelling. </li>
    <li> Keep the surgical incision clean and dry. Cover the area with plastic wrap when bathing or showering. </li>
    <li> Physical therapy may be ordered to restore wrist strength. </li>
    <li> Eating a healthy diet and not smoking will promote healing </li>
</ul>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery </h2>
<p> Most patients suffer no complications following carpal tunnel release surgery. However, some patients may suffer from pain, infections, scarring, and nerve damage causing weakness, paralysis, or loss of sensation and stiffness in the hand and wrist area. </p>

<h1>Hip Arthroscopy</h1>
<h2> What is Arthroscopy? </h2>
<p> Arthroscopy, also referred to as keyhole or minimally invasive surgery, is a procedure in which an arthroscope is inserted into a joint to check for any damage and repair it simultaneously. </p>
<p> An arthroscope is a small, fiber-optic instrument consisting of a lens, light source, and video camera. The camera projects an image of the inside of the joint onto a large screen monitor allowing the surgeon to look for any damage, assess the type of injury, and repair the problem. </p>
<h2> Indications of Hip Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> Hip arthroscopy is a surgical procedure performed through very small incisions to diagnose and treat various hip conditions including: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Removal of torn cartilage or bone chips that cause hip pain and immobility </li>
    <li> Repair a torn labrum (fibrous cartilage ring that lines the acetabular socket) </li>
    <li> Removal of bone spurs or extra bone growths caused by arthritis or an injury. </li>
    <li> Removal of part of the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint) in patients with inflammatory arthritis (partial synovectomy) </li>
    <li> Repair of fractures or torn ligaments caused by trauma </li>
    <li> Evaluation and diagnosis of conditions with unexplained pain, swelling, or stiffness in the hip that does not respond to conservative treatment </li>
</ul>
<h2> Hip Arthroscopy Procedure </h2>
<p> Hip arthroscopy is performed under regional or general anesthesia depending on you and your surgeon's preference. </p>
<p> Your surgeon will make 2 or 3 small incisions about 1/4 inch in length around the hip joint. Through one of the incisions an arthroscope is inserted. Along with it, a sterile solution is pumped into the joint to expand the joint area and create room for the surgeon to work. </p>
<p> The larger image on the television monitor allows the surgeon to visualize the joint directly to determine the extent of damage so that it can be surgically treated. Surgical instruments will be inserted through other tiny incisions to treat the problem. After the surgery, the incisions are closed and covered with a bandage. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Hip Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> The advantages of hip arthroscopy over the traditional open hip surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Smaller incisions </li>
    <li> Minimal trauma to surrounding ligaments, muscles, and tissues </li>
    <li> Less pain </li>
    <li> Faster recovery </li>
    <li> Lower infection rate </li>
    <li> Less scarring </li>
    <li> Early mobilization </li>
    <li> Shorter hospital stay </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative Care for Hip Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> Your doctor may advise you to take certain precautions to promote faster recovery and prevent further complications. These include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Taking pain medications as prescribed </li>
    <li> Use of crutches to prevent or limit bearing weight on the operated hip </li>
    <li> Physical therapy exercises should be performed to restore normal hip function and improve flexibility and strength </li>
    <li> Eating a healthy diet and avoiding smoking will help in faster healing and recovery </li>
    <li> Avoid activity which involves lifting heavy things or strenuous exercises for the first few weeks after surgery </li>
</ul>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Hip Arthroscopy </h2>
<p> As with any surgery, there are potential risks and complications involved. It is very important that you are informed of these risks before you decide to proceed with hip arthroscopy surgery. Possible risks and complications include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Infection at the surgical incision site or in the joint space </li>
    <li> Nerve damage which may cause numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness </li>
    <li> Excess bleeding into the joint, a condition called hemarthrosis </li>
    <li> Blood clots may form inside the deep veins of the legs which can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). </li>

<h1>Knee Ligament Reconstruction</h1>
<h2> Knee Anatomy </h2>
<p> The knee is the most complex joint in the body and is formed by the articulation between the thighbone (femur) and the shinbone (tibia). A kneecap is present over the front of the joint to provide extra protection. These bones are held together by four strong rope- like structures called ligaments. Two collateral ligaments are present on either side of the knee and control the sideway movements of the knee. The other two ligaments are the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, ACL and PCL respectively, which are present in the center of the knee joint and cross each other to form an "X". The cruciate ligaments control the back and forth movement of the knee. </p>
<h2> Knee Ligament Injuries </h2>
<p> Knee ligament injuries are common in athletes involved in contact sports such as soccer, football and basketball. Knee ligament injuries are graded based on the severity of injury. </p>
<ul>
    <li> In grade I, the ligament is mildly damaged and slightly stretched, but the knee joint is stable. </li>
    <li> In grade II, there is a partial tear of the ligament. </li>
    <li> In grade III, there is a complete tear of the ligament and the ligament is divided into two halves making the knee joint unstable. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Arthroscopic Knee Ligament Reconstruction Procedure </h2>
<p> The surgical repair of the completely torn ligament involves reconstruction of the torn ligament using a tissue graft taken from another part of the body or from a donor. The damaged ligament is replaced by the graft and fixed to the femur and tibia using metallic screws. Gradually, over a period of a few months, the graft heals. </p>
<p> Arthroscopic reconstruction of the knee ligament is a minimally invasive surgery performed through a few tiny incisions. An arthroscope is inserted into the knee joint through one of the small incisions to provide clear images of the surgical area (inside the knee) to the surgeon on a television monitor. Guided by these images the surgeon performs the surgery using small surgical instruments inserted through the other small incisions around the knee. </p>
<h2> Advantages of Arthroscopic Knee Ligament Reconstruction </h2>
<p> As the surgery is performed through small incisions it provides the following benefits: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Less post-operative pain </li>
    <li> Shorter hospital stay </li>
    <li> Quicker recovery. </li>
</ul>
<p> Following arthroscopic reconstruction of the injured ligament most athletes can return to their high-level sport after a period of rehabilitation. </p>
<h1>Knee Cartilage Repair and Restoration</h1>
<h2> What is Cartilage Transplantation? </h2>
<p> The articular surfaces of the body's joints are lined by hyaline cartilage, a smooth tissue that serves as a shock absorber and allows easy movement of the bones within the joint. Normal wear-and-tear or injury can damage and cause defects in the cartilage, resulting in irregular articular surfaces that interfere with movement, causing pain, swelling and disability. Cartilage cell transplantation is a technique of transplanting healthy cartilage cells to replace damaged cartilage cells. These procedures are recommended for young individuals with a single articular defect. It is usually performed on the knee joint but may also be used to treat the shoulder and ankle joints. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) involves the removal of cartilage cells from your own body. The procedure is accomplished in 2 stages. The initial stage is an arthroscopic procedure where healthy cartilage is harvested from a non-weight bearing joint of your own body and sent to the laboratory, where the cartilage cells are extracted and cultured (multiplied) for a period of 3 to 5 weeks. In the next stage, an open surgery (arthrotomy) is performed where the dead joint tissue is removed and the defect prepared appropriately. A piece of membrane called periosteum that lines bone surfaces is obtained, usually from the tibia, and sewn over the defect and sealed with glue. Your doctor then injects the cartilage cells under the membrane into the defect where they grow and mature to form new cartilage. Other variants of cartilage cell transplantation include the DeNovo graft and BioCartilage, which use pre-prepared human cartilage graft material. These procedures can be performed in one stage as they do not require harvesting of healthy cartilage tissue. The DeNovo graft consists of pieces of viable cartilage in a storage media. Similar to ACI, the damaged cartilage area is prepared and sized. The graft is then prepared with a fibrin sealant and placed on the defect. The sealant precludes the need of a periosteal membrane. BioCartilage consists of dehydrated cartilage, which is introduced along with platelet-rich plasma (concentrated blood component, which enhances healing) on the defects after a technique called microfracture is performed. Microfracture involves the creation of multiple holes at the damaged site to introduce blood supply and stimulate new cartilage to grow. The BioCartilage and platelet-rich plasma further promote cell growth and healing. </p>

<h1>Total Knee Replacement</h1>
<h2> What is Arthritis? </h2>
<p> The knee is made up of the femur (thighbone), the tibia (shinbone), and patella (kneecap). The meniscus, the soft cartilage between the femur and tibia, serves as a cushion and helps absorb shock during motion. Arthritis (inflammation of the joints), injury, or other diseases of the joint can damage this protective layer of cartilage, causing extreme pain and difficulty in performing daily activities. Osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis. Your doctor may recommend surgery if non-surgical treatment options have failed to relieve the symptoms. </p>
<h2> Causes of Osteoarthritis </h2>
<p> The exact cause of osteoarthritis is not known, however, there are several factors that are commonly associated with the onset of arthritis and may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Injury or trauma to the joint </li>
    <li> Fractures at the knee joint </li>
    <li> Increased body weight </li>
    <li> Repetitive overuse </li>
    <li> Joint infection </li>
    <li> Inflammation of the joint </li>
    <li> Connective tissue disorders </li>
</ul>
<h2> Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis </h2>
<p> Your doctor will diagnose osteoarthritis based on the medical history, physical examination, and X-rays. </p>
<p> X-rays typically show a narrowing of the joint space in the arthritic knee. </p>
<h2> What is Total Knee Replacement? </h2>
<p> Total knee replacement, also called total knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure in which the worn out or damaged surfaces of the knee joint are removed and replaced with artificial parts. </p>
<h2> Indications for Total Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> Total knee replacement surgery is commonly indicated for severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of knee arthritis in which the joint cartilage gradually wears away. It often affects older people. </p>
<p> In a normal joint, articular cartilage allows for smooth movement within the joint, whereas in an arthritic knee, the cartilage itself becomes thinner or completely absent. In addition, the bones become thicker around the edges of the joint and may form bony "spurs". These factors can cause pain and restrict range of motion in the joint. </p>
<p> Your doctor may advise total knee replacement if you have: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Severe knee pain which limits your daily activities (such as walking, getting up from a chair or climbing stairs). </li>
    <li> Moderate to severe pain that occurs during rest or awakens you at night. </li>
    <li> Chronic knee inflammation and swelling that is not relieved with rest or medications </li>
    <li> Failure to obtain pain relief from medications, injections, physical therapy, or other conservative treatments. </li>
    <li> A bow- legged knee deformity </li>
</ul>
<h2> Total Knee Replacement Procedure </h2>
<p> The goal of total knee replacement surgery is to relieve pain and restore the alignment and function of your knee. </p>
<p> The surgery is performed under spinal or general anesthesia. Your surgeon will make an incision in the skin over the affected knee to expose the knee joint. Then, the damaged portions of the femur bone are cut at appropriate angles using specialized jigs. The femoral component is attached to the end of the femur with or without bone cement. </p>
<p> The surgeon then cuts or shaves the damaged area of the tibia (shinbone) and the cartilage. This removes the deformed part of the bone and any bony growths, as well as creates a smooth surface on which the implants can be attached. Next, the tibial component is secured to the end of the bone with bone cement or screws. </p>
<p> Your surgeon will place a plastic piece called an articular surface between the implants to provide a smooth gliding surface for movement. This plastic insert will support the body's weight and allow the femur to move over the tibia, like the original meniscus cartilage. </p>
<p> The femur and the tibia with the new components are then put together to form the new knee joint. </p>
<p> To make sure the patella (kneecap) glides smoothly over the new artificial knee, its rear surface is also prepared to receive a plastic component. </p>
<p> With all the new components in place, the knee joint is tested through its range of motion. The entire joint is then irrigated and cleaned with a sterile solution. The incision is carefully closed; drains are inserted and a sterile dressing is placed over the incision. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care Following Total Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> Rehabilitation begins immediately following the surgery. A physical therapist will teach you specific exercises to strengthen your leg and restore knee movement. Knee immobilizers are used to stabilize the knee. You will be able to walk with crutches or a walker. A continuous passive motion (CPM) machine can be used to move the knee joint. Continuous passive motion is a device attached to the treated leg which constantly moves the joint through a controlled range of motion, while the patient relaxes. Your physical therapist will also provide you with a home exercise program to strengthen thigh and calf muscles. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of Total Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> As with any major surgery, possible risks and complications associated with total knee replacement surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Knee stiffness </li>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) </li>
    <li> Nerve and blood vessel damage </li>
    <li> Ligament injuries </li>
    <li> Patella (kneecap) dislocation </li>
    <li> Plastic liner wearing out </li>
    <li> Loosening of the implant </li>
</ul>
<p> If you find it difficult to perform simple activities such as walking or climbing stairs because of your severe arthritic knee pain, then total knee replacement may be an option for you. It is a safe and effective procedure to relieve pain, correct leg deformity, and help you resume your normal activities of daily living. </p>

<h1>Computer Navigation for Total Knee Replacement</h1>
<h2> What is Total Knee Replacement? </h2>
<p> A total knee replacement surgery involves replacing the damaged surfaces of the articulating bones with artificial implants. Most of these implants wear with use. Thus, the risk of need for revision surgery is high in young and active people if the implant must last the lifetime of the patient. The life of the implant can be extended by precise alignment of the implant and this can be achieved using computer navigation for total knee replacement surgery. </p>
<h2> Indications for Total Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> A total knee replacement surgery is the last resort to relieve pain and restore function in the knee damaged by arthritis or an injury when non-surgical treatments do not relieve the condition. </p>
<h2> Computer Navigation for Total Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> Computer-navigation provides your surgeon with real time 3-D images of your mapped knee and the surgical instruments during surgery. The data for the images is provided by the infrared sensors fixed to the bones of the knee and the surgical instruments. Their position is tracked by an infrared camera placed above the surgical table connected to the computer. The computer than generates the real-time images with the help of the appropriate software to guide the surgeon to precisely resurface and cut the bones of the knee and fix the implant precisely and accurately according to the pre-operative surgical plan. </p>
<p> Thus, the surgery is done by the surgeon only. Computer navigation is just a tool to guide the surgeon and improve the outcome of the surgery. It cannot replace the skills of an experienced surgeon. </p>
<h1>Partial Knee Replacement</h1>
<h2> Disease Overview of Arthritis </h2>
<p> Arthritis is inflammation of a joint causing pain, swelling (inflammation), and stiffness. </p>
<p> Osteoarthritis is the most common form of knee arthritis in which the joint cartilage gradually wears away. It most often affects older people. In a normal joint, articular cartilage allows for smooth movement within the joint, where as in an arthritic knee the cartilage itself becomes thinner or completely absent. In addition, the bones become thicker around the edges of the joint and may form bony "spurs". These factors can cause pain and restricted range of motion in the joint. </p>
<h2> Causes of Arthritis </h2>
<p> The exact cause is unknown, however, there are several factors that are commonly associated with the onset of arthritis and may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Injury or trauma to the joint </li>
    <li> Fractures of the knee joint </li>

    <li> Repetitive overuse </li>
    <li> Joint infection </li>
    <li> Inflammation of the joint </li>
    <li> Connective tissue disorders </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of Arthritis </h2>
<p> Arthritis of the knees can cause knee pain, which may increase after activities such as walking, stair climbing or kneeling. </p>
<p> The joint may become stiff and swollen, limiting the range of motion. Knee deformities such as knock-knees and bow-legs may also occur. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of Arthritis </h2>
<p> Your doctor will diagnose osteoarthritis based on the medical history, physical examination, and X-rays. </p>
<p> X-rays typically show a narrowing of joint space in the arthritic knee. </p>
<h2>What is Unicompartmental Knee Replacement?</h2>
<p> Unicompartmental knee replacement is a minimally invasive surgery in which only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced with an implant. It is also called a partial knee replacement. </p>
<p> The knee can be divided into three compartments: patellofemoral, the compartment in front of the knee between the kneecap and thighbone, medial compartment, on the inside portion of the knee, and lateral compartment which is the area on the outside portion of the knee joint. </p>
<h2>Indications of Unicompartmental Knee Replacement</h2>
<p> Traditionally, total knee replacement was commonly indicated for severe osteoarthritis of the knee. In total knee replacement, all worn out or damaged surfaces of the knee joint are removed and replaced with new artificial parts. Partial knee replacement is a surgical option if your arthritis is confined to a single compartment of your knee. </p>
<h2> Surgical Procedure of Unicompartmental Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> Your doctor may recommend surgery if non-surgical treatment options such as medications, injections and physical therapy have failed to relieve the symptoms. </p>
<p> During the surgery, a small incision is made over the knee to expose the knee joint. Your surgeon will remove only the damaged part of the meniscus and place the implant into the bone by slightly shaping the shinbone and the thighbone. The plastic component is placed into the new prepared area and is secured with bone cement. Now the damaged part of the femur or thighbone is removed to accommodate the new metal component which is fixed in place using bone cement. Once the femoral and tibial components are fixed in proper place the knee is taken through a range of movements. The muscles and tendons are then repaired and the incision is closed. </p>
<h2> Postoperative Care Following Unicompartmental Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> You may walk with the help of a walker or cane for the first 1-2 weeks after surgery. A physical therapist will advise you on an exercise program to follow for 4 to 6 months to help maintain range of motion and restore your strength. You may perform exercises such as walking, swimming and biking but high impact activities such as jogging should be avoided. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications Following Surgery for Unicompartmental Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> Possible risks and complications associated with unicompartmental knee replacement include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Knee stiffness </li>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Blood clots (Deep vein thrombosis) </li>
    <li> Nerve and blood vessel damage </li>
    <li> Ligament injuries </li>
    <li> Patella (kneecap) dislocation </li>
    <li> Plastic liner wears out </li>
    <li> Loosening of the implant </li>
</ul>
<h2> Advantages of Unicompartmental Knee Replacement </h2>
<p> The advantages of Unicompartmental Knee Replacement over Total Knee Replacement include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Smaller incision </li>
    <li> Less blood loss </li>
    <li> Quick recovery </li>
    <li> Less post-operative pain </li>
    <li> Better overall range of motion </li>
    <li> Feels more like a natural knee </li>

<h1>ACL Reconstruction</h1>
<h2> Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears </h2>
<p> The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the major stabilizing ligaments in the knee. It is a strong rope- like structure located in the center of the knee running from the femur to the tibia. When this ligament tears unfortunately, it does not heal and often leads to the feeling of instability in the knee. </p>
<h2> Causes of ACL Injury </h2>
<p> An ACL injury most commonly occurs during sports that involve twisting or overextending your knee. An ACL can be injured in several ways: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Sudden directional change </li>
    <li> Slowing down while running </li>
    <li> Landing from a jump incorrectly </li>
    <li> Direct blow to the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of ACL Injury </h2>
<p> When you injure your ACL, you might hear a loud "pop" sound and you may feel the knee buckle. Within a few hours after an ACL injury, your knee may swell due to bleeding from vessels within the torn ligament. You may notice that the knee feels unstable or seems to give way, especially when trying to change direction on the knee. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of ACL Injury </h2>
<p> An ACL injury can be diagnosed with a thorough physical examination of the knee and diagnostic tests such as X-rays, MRI scans and arthroscopy. X-rays may be needed to rule out any fractures. In addition, your doctor will often perform the Lachman's test to see if the ACL is intact. During a Lachman test, the knee with a torn ACL may show increased forward movement of the tibia and a soft or mushy endpoint compared to a healthy knee. </p>
<p> Pivot shift test is another test to assess ACL tear. During this test, if the ACL is torn, the tibia will move forward when the knee is completely straight and as the knee bends past 30° the tibia shifts back into correct place in relation to the femur. </p>
<h2> What is ACL Reconstruction? </h2>
<p> ACL reconstruction is a commonly performed surgical procedure and with recent advances in arthroscopic surgery can now be performed with minimal incision and low complication rates. </p>
<p> The advancements in arthroscopic surgery make it easy for surgeons to see and work on knee structures through small incisions. Repair of the torn ligament can be performed at the same time as the diagnostic arthroscopy with fewer surgical risks. </p>
<p> The surgery can usually be done as an outpatient procedure which means you may be discharged to go home on the same day as the procedure. </p>

    <li> Direct blow to the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of ACL Injury </h2>
<p> When you injure your ACL, you might hear a loud "pop" sound and you may feel the knee buckle. Within a few hours after an ACL injury, your knee may swell due to bleeding from vessels within the torn ligament. You may notice that the knee feels unstable or seems to give way, especially when trying to change direction on the knee. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of ACL Injury </h2>
<p> An ACL injury can be diagnosed with a thorough physical examination of the knee and diagnostic tests such as X-rays, MRI scans and arthroscopy. X-rays may be needed to rule out any fractures. In addition, your doctor will often perform the Lachman's test to see if the ACL is intact. During a Lachman test, the knee with a torn ACL may show increased forward movement of the tibia and a soft or mushy endpoint compared to a healthy knee. </p>
<p> Pivot shift test is another test to assess ACL tear. During this test, if the ACL is torn, the tibia will move forward when the knee is completely straight and as the knee bends past 30° the tibia shifts back into correct place in relation to the femur. </p>
<p> The goal of ACL reconstruction surgery is to tighten your knee and to restore its stability. </p>
<p> Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction hamstring method is a surgical procedure to replace the torn ACL with part of the hamstring tendon taken from the patient's leg. The Hamstring is the muscle located on the back of your thigh. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. </p>
<p> Your surgeon will make two small cuts about 1/4-inch-long around your knee. An arthroscope, a tube with a small video camera on the end is inserted through one incision to see the inside of the knee joint. Along with the arthroscope, a sterile solution is pumped into the joint to expand it enabling the surgeon to have a clear view and space to work inside the joint. </p>
<p> The knee is bent at right angles and the hamstring tendons felt. A small incision is made over the hamstring tendon attachment to the tibia and the two tendons are stripped off the muscle and the graft is prepared. The torn ACL will be removed and the pathway for the new ACL is prepared. The arthroscope is reinserted into the knee joint through one of the small incisions. Small holes are drilled into the upper and lower leg bones where these bones come together at the knee joint. The holes form tunnels in your bone to accept the new graft. Then the graft is pulled through the predrilled holes in the tibia and femur. The new tendon is then fixed into the bone with screws to hold it into place while the ligament heals into the bone. </p>
<p> The incisions are then closed with sutures and a dressing is placed. </p>
<h2> Risks and complications of ACL Reconstruction - Hamstring Tendon </h2>
<p> Possible risks and complications associated with ACL reconstruction with hamstring method include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Numbness </li>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Blood clots (Deep vein thrombosis) </li>
    <li> Nerve and blood vessel damage </li>
    <li> Failure of the graft </li>
    <li> Loosening of the graft </li>
    <li> Decreased range of motion </li>
    <li> Crepitus (crackling or grating feeling of the kneecap) </li>
    <li> Pain in the knee </li>
    <li> Repeat injury to the graft </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative care following ACL Reconstruction - Hamstring Tendon </h2>
<p> Following the surgery, rehabilitation begins immediately. A physical therapist will teach you specific exercises to be performed to strengthen your leg and restore knee movement. Avoid competitive sports for 5 to 6 months to allow the new graft to incorporate into the knee joint. </p>
<p> Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a very common and successful procedure. It is usually indicated in patients wishing to return to an active lifestyle especially those wishing to play sports involving running and twisting. Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a common knee ligament injury. If you have injured your ACL, surgery may be needed to regain full function of your knee. </p>

<h1>ACL Reconstruction Patellar Tendon</h1>
<h2> What is ACL Reconstruction Patellar Tendon Method? </h2>
<p> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patellar tendon is a surgical procedure that replaces the injured ACL with a patellar tendon. Anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four major ligaments of the knee that connects the femur (thighbone) to the tibia (shinbone) and helps stabilize the knee joint. Anterior cruciate ligament prevents excessive forward movement of the lower leg bone (tibia) in relation to the thighbone (femur) as well as limits rotational movements of the knee. </p>
<h2> ACL Injuries </h2>
<p> A tear of this ligament can make you feel as though your knees will not allow you to move or even hold you up. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the torn ligament of your knee with a tissue graft. </p>
<h2> Causes of ACL Injuries </h2>
<p> An ACL injury most commonly occurs during sports that involve twisting or overextending your knee. The ACL can be injured in several ways: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Sudden directional change </li>
    <li> Slowing down while running </li>
    <li> Landing from a jump incorrectly </li>
    <li> Direct blow to the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle </li>
</ul>
<h2> Symptoms of ACL Injuries </h2>

<h2> ACL Reconstruction Patellar Tendon Procedure </h2>
<p> The goal of ACL reconstruction surgery is to tighten your knee and to restore its stability. </p>
<p> Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patellar tendon is a surgical procedure to replace the torn ACL with part of the patellar tendon taken from the patient's leg. The new ACL is harvested from the patellar tendon that connects the bottom of the kneecap (patella) to the top of the shinbone (tibia). The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. </p>
<p> Your surgeon will make two small cuts about ¼ inch around your knee. An arthroscope, a tube with a small video camera on the end is inserted through one incision to see the inside of the knee joint. Along with the arthroscope, a sterile solution is pumped into the knee to expand it, providing the surgeon a clear view of the inside of the joint. </p>
<p> The torn ACL will be removed and the pathway for the new ACL is prepared. Your surgeon makes an incision over the patellar tendon and takes out the middle third of the patellar tendon, along with small plugs of bone where it is attached on each end. The remaining portions of the patellar tendon on either side of the graft are sutured back after its removal. Then the incision is closed. The arthroscope is reinserted into the knee joint through one of the small incisions. Small holes are drilled into the upper and lower leg bones where these bones come together at the knee joint. The holes form tunnels in your bone to accept the new graft. Then the graft is pulled through the predrilled holes in the tibia and femur. The new tendon is then fixed into the bone with screws to hold it into place while the ligament heals into the bone. </p>

<h1>PCL Reconstruction</h1>
<h2> Posterior Cruciate Ligament Anatomy </h2>
<p> Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), one of four major ligaments of the knee is situated at the back of the knee. It connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia). The PCL limits the backward motion of the shinbone. </p>
<h2> What are PCL Injuries? </h2>
<p> PCL injuries are very rare and are more difficult to detect than other knee ligament injuries. Cartilage injuries, bone bruises, and ligament injuries often occur in combination with PCL injuries. Injuries to the PCL can be graded as I, II or III depending on the severity of injury. </p>
<ul>
    <li> In grade I, the ligament is mildly damaged and slightly stretched, but the knee joint is stable. </li>
    <li> In grade II, there is a partial tear of the ligament. </li>
    <li> In grade III, there is a complete tear of the ligament and the ligament is divided into two halves making the knee joint unstable. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Causes of PCL Injuries </h2>
<p> The PCL is usually injured by a direct impact, such as in an automobile accident when the bent knee forcefully strikes the dashboard. In sports, it can occur when an athlete falls to the ground with a bent knee. Twisting injury or overextending the knee can cause the PCL to tear. </p>
<h2> Symptoms of PCL Injuries </h2>
<p> Patients with PCL injuries usually experience knee pain and swelling immediately after the injury. There may also be instability in the knee joint, knee stiffness that causes limping, and difficulty in walking. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of PCL Injuries </h2>
<p> Diagnosis of a PCL tear is made based on your symptoms, medical history, and by performing a physical examination of the knee. Other diagnostic tests such as X-rays and MRI scan may be ordered. X-rays are useful to rule out avulsion fractures wherein the PCL tears off a piece of bone along with it. An MRI scan is done to help view the images of soft tissues better. </p>
<h2> Treatment Options for PCL Injuries </h2>
<p> Treatment options may include non-surgical and surgical treatment. Non-surgical treatment consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE protocol); all assist in controlling pain and swelling. Physical therapy may be recommended to improve knee motion and strength. A knee brace may be needed to help immobilize your knee. Crutches may be recommended to protect your knee and avoid bearing weight on your leg. </p>
<h2> PCL Reconstruction Procedure </h2>
<p> Generally, surgery is considered in patients with a dislocated knee and multiple ligament injuries, including the PCL. Surgery involves reconstruction of the torn ligament using a tissue graft taken from another part of the body, or from a donor. </p>
<p> Surgery is usually carried out with the help of an arthroscope, using a few small incisions. The basic steps involved in PCL reconstruction are as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The surgeon inspects the knee and removes any remains of the native PCL, using an arthroscopic shaver. Care is taken to preserve the ligament of Wrisberg, if it is intact. </li>
    <li> The donor tendon is harvested from the patellar tendon or the semi tendinosis and gracilis tendon. </li>
    <li> The soft tissue around the femur is debrided to assist the insertion of the graft. </li>
    <li> A tunnel is created in the femur at the anatomic attachment site of the anterolateral bundle at the anteromedial wall of the intercondylar notch. This tunnel is drilled about 6-8 mm from the articular surface of medial femoral condyle. </li>
    <li> The tibial attachment site is also prepared by identifying the normal attachment of the PCL, at the bottom of the PCL facet. </li>
    <li> For placing the graft, a tibial tunnel is created to the anatomic insertion of the PCL on the tibia. </li>
    <li> Once the tunnels are drilled, the sharp edges and soft tissues around the exit site of the tunnel are smoothed, with a rasp. </li>
    <li> The tendon allograft is inserted in the femoral tunnel and fixed with a cannulated interference screw. </li>
    <li> The graft is made taut distally by removing any slack in the graft. </li>
    <li> The graft is then fixed to the tibia, with the help of staples. </li>
    <li> After fixation, normal posterior stability of the knee is assessed by employing the posterior drawer test. </li>
    <li> The incision is closed with sutures and covered with sterile dressings. </li>
</ul>
<h2> Postoperative Care following PCL Reconstruction </h2>
<p> Patients are advised to maintain the knee in full extension, supported by a knee brace, for a period of 2 to 4 weeks. Patients should not bear any weight on the operated knee. Pillows or other supports are placed under the tibia, for the first two months after surgery, to prevent any posterior subluxation of the tibia. </p>
<p> Weight-bearing and rehabilitation is initiated after 8 weeks. Crutches are often required until you regain your normal strength. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of PCL Reconstruction </h2>
<p> Knee stiffness and residual instability are the most common complications associated with PCL reconstruction. The other possible complications include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Numbness </li>
    <li> Infection </li>
    <li> Blood clots (Deep vein thrombosis) </li>
    <li> Nerve and blood vessel damage </li>
    <li> Failure of the graft </li>
    <li> Loosening of the graft </li>
    <li> Decreased range of motion </li>
</ul>

<h1>MCL Reconstruction</h1>
<h2> MCL Anatomy </h2>
<p> Medial collateral ligament (MCL) is one of four major ligaments of the knee that connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) and is present on the inside of the knee joint. This ligament helps stabilize the knee. </p>
<h2> MCL Injury - Strains and Tears </h2>
<p> An injury to the MCL may occur as a result of direct impact to the knee. An MCL injury can result in a minor stretch (sprain) or a partial or complete tear of the ligament. </p>
<h2> Symptoms for MCL Injuries </h2>
<p> The most common symptoms following an MCL injury include pain, swelling, and joint instability. </p>
<h2> Diagnosis of MCL Injuries </h2>
<p> An MCL injury can be diagnosed with a thorough physical examination of the knee and diagnostic imaging tests such as X-rays, arthroscopy, and MRI scans. X-rays may help rule out any fractures. In addition, your doctor will perform a valgus stress test to check for stability of the MCL. In this test, the knee is bent approximately 30&deg; and pressure is applied on the outside surface of the knee. Excessive pain or laxity is indicative of medial collateral ligament injury. </p>
<h2> Management of MCL Injuries </h2>
<p> If the overall stability of the knee is intact, your doctor will recommend non-surgical methods including ice, physical therapy, and bracing. </p>
<p> Surgical reconstruction is rarely recommended for MCL tears, but may be necessary in patients whose injury fails to heal properly with residual knee instability. These cases are often associated with other ligament injuries. If surgery is required, a ligament repair may be performed, with or without reconstruction with a tendon graft; depending on the location and severity of the injury. </p>
<h2> Indications and Contraindications of MCL Reconstruction </h2>
<p> Medial collateral ligament reconstruction is indicated in patients with chronic MCL instability despite appropriate non-surgical treatment. </p>
<p> Medial collateral ligament reconstruction is contraindicated in patients with degenerative changes in the medial or lateral compartment, active infection, ligament instability, or presence of chronic diseases that can hamper surgical management or compliance to post-operative rehabilitation instructions. </p>
<h2> MCL Reconstruction Procedure </h2>
<p> The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Arthroscopic examination of the knee may be performed to rule out any associated injuries including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament PCL) tears. </p>
<p> The surgical procedure for medial collateral ligament reconstruction involves the following steps: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Your surgeon will make an incision over the medial femoral condyle. </li>
    <li> Care is taken to move muscles, tendons and nerves out of the way. </li>

    <li> The donor tendon is usually harvested from the Achilles tendon. </li>

    <li> The soft tissue around the femur is debrided to assist the insertion of the Achilles bone plug. </li>

    <li> For placing the graft, a tunnel is created from a guide pin to the anatomic insertion of the MCL on the tibia, using the index finger and surgical scissors. </li>

    <li> The Achilles tendon allograft is inserted in the femoral tunnel and fixed using screws. </li>

    <li> The MCL graft is made taut, with the knee at 20° flexion under varus stress, and fixed to the tibia with a screw and a spiked washer. </li>
    <li> The incision is closed with sutures and covered with sterile dressings. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Post-operative Care following MCL Reconstruction </h2>
<p> In the first two weeks after the surgery, toe-touch and weight-bearing is allowed with the knee brace locked in full extension. After 2 weeks, 0° to 30° of motion is allowed at the knee. At 4 weeks, knee flexion is allowed from 60° to 90° of motion and full weight-bearing is permitted. At 6 weeks, the brace is removed, and you are allowed to perform full range of motion. Crutches are often required until you regain your normal strength. </p>
<h2> Risks and Complications of MCL Reconstruction </h2>
<p> Knee stiffness and residual instability are the most common complications associated with MCL reconstruction. The other possible complications include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Numbness </li>

    <li> Infection </li>

    <li> Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) </li>

    <li> Nerve and blood vessel damage </li>

    <li> Failure of the graft </li>

    <li> Loosening of the graft </li>

    <li> Decreased range of motion </li>

<h2> C. Hermann - Collegiate Athlete - Knee Surgery   </h2>
<p> Since my sophomore year of high school I have had daily knee pain. It started as a minor pain and progressed to a debilitating level. For nearly 6 years, athletic trainers, chiropractors, family physicians and even specialists treated me for "knee tendonitis" with little improvement. I attended physical therapy, did stretching and exercises and iced for hours each day. Some nights I would end up on the floor clenching my knee, massaging it and doing everything possible to get some pain relief. Nothing seemed to work. That's when I researched and found the team at OAK Orthopedics. </p>
<p> Dr Antkowiak and his partner Dr Lee were very knowledgeable and friendly. They examined my knee, obtained X-rays and an MRI and diagnosed me with calcific tendonitis. Over the years a large calcium deposit had formed in my patellar tendon and was causing the terrible pain. Dr Antkowiak took the time to explain the diagnosis and the treatment options. He offered a minimally invasive technique for removing the calcium and repairing the tendon. The surgery was scheduled within two weeks and it went great! My pain was improved almost immediately. Within 3-4 weeks of surgery I was able to squat my body weight easily and within 2 months I had made a full recovery and resumed strength training. My knee hadn't felt that great in years. At 5 months post-op and my strength and function are better than ever before.  There is no pain and I'm able to jump and play without limitations. I am extremely grateful for the efforts of all the specialists at OAK Orthopedics, especially to my surgeon Dr. Tom Antkowiak. </p>

<h2> R. O'Dette - Tinley Park, IL - ACL & Meniscus Surgery </h2>
<p> I hurt my knee when I was just 10 years old and lived with the constant pain for over 30 years. This past summer, my knee swelled and the pain became unbearable. I made an appointment with Oak Orthopedics, and that's when I met Dr. Antkowiak. He took the time to listen and after an exam and MRI Dr. Antkowiak discovered that I had a badly torn meniscus and an ACL tear.  We had a discussion about the diagnosis and Dr Antkowiak explained the treatment options. We decided to fix the tears surgically. I have never had an operation so, on the morning of my surgery, I was feeling a little scared. All that changed when I arrived at the OAK surgical institute. Everyone there made my experience easy and memorable. I felt very comfortable and safe there. Dr Antkowiak and the team were very professional and compassionate. I couldn't have asked for anything better! I am now 8 months out from my surgery and I feel great! My knee has not felt this healthy in a long time; I have no more pain or discomfort.  I can't thank Dr. Antkowiak and his staff enough for taking such great care of me! </p>

<h2> C Onwiler - Frankfort, IL - Shoulder injury </h2>
<p> On Fathers Day, 2014, I destroyed my collarbone in an accident.  It was broken in multiple pieces and was displaced. I was in trouble and I knew only a surgery would fix this. </p>
<p> The next day, I saw Dr. Antkowiak.  I liked him immediately.  His enthusiasm was infectious.  He was upbeat and confident. He explained all the options and assured me that I'd be on the road to recovery quickly. Due to the severely displaced fracture we decided to pursue surgery. Things went great; I got through surgery without any problems. Dr Antkowiak was committed to getting the best repair possible. His dedication to perfection was obvious. Perhaps this comes from his being so involved in sports medicine but one thing is for sure:  You  want  a surgeon with an attitude like that screwing your bones back together.   </p>
<p> My surgery was a complete success. Four months later, I'm living my life exactly as I did before the injury.  I can work and play just as hard as I ever could previously.  I'd like to think that it was divine guidance which brought me to a doctor who is an enthusiastic perfectionist.  Throughout my recovery, Dr. A and his entire staff treated me like the most important person in their care.  I'd recommend Dr. Antkowiak and his team to anyone.  While I pray that I'll never be busted up enough to need him again, you can bet that Dr. A will remain my go-to guy in orthopedic surgery. </p>
